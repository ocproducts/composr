DOC_GDPR=The EU GDPR regulation grants rights to users including:\n - Right to be able to access all personal data stored on them\n - Right to be 'forgotten' (have their data scrubbed for deletion or at least anonymised)\nFor this reason there is a privacy module in the Admin Zone for facilitating this, with these features:\n - Ability to download a user's data in a serialised format\n - Ability to mass-delete and/or mass-anonymise all a user's data\n - Ability to generate SQL queries for manually searching the database (useful for making more careful changes)\nThese features can only work based on what Composr knows from its database structure. You may hold other data outside Composr, or not directly associated via database structure which you will still be responsible for.
TEXT_PRIVACY_SEARCH=Fill at least one field to find matching personal records, to have the selected privacy-action performed. If you fill multiple fields then results will be returned that match any of those fields.<br /><br />Be careful to verify whatever search parameters you given are legitimate, not some kind of fraud or overly-broad. For example, if given an IP address to purge, it is possible that the address might be a dynamic address that was also used by other members. Make sure you have good backups.
DESCRIPTION_PRIVACY_OTHER=Matching will be performed against any other text field known to only contain user-data, such as phone number, name, or address fields. Be careful with this as it may be overly-broad, it is only rarely useful.
