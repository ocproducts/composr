[strings]
DOC_PERMISSIONS_TREE=The Permissions Tree Editor allows you to see and set permissions for all site structure and content from a single user-friendly interface. It is designed to allow quick setting of permissions without having to trawl through a different screen for everything being worked with.
DOC_PRIVILEGES=Privileges -- rather than controlling access permissions, control whether somebody is allowed to do something more specific, such as use high-level Comcode, or bypass the word-filter. Think of them as 'privileges'.
DOC_PAGE_MATCH_KEY_ACCESS=If it is not enough to specify whether a member can access a specific page based on the available view permissions and overridden privileges, you can also set things up to deny access to pages based on the URL parameters they are opened with. This could be used, for example, to allow members to browse through download categories but not actually view any download entry.\nThe match-key permission system is not intended to be used unless really needed - it is there to provide additional control when page and privileges won't meet your unique needs.\n\nTo add a new match-key permission, go to the "Match-key page restriction" icon in the Security section of the Admin Zone.\n\nAn example match-key that would deny access for viewing download entries would be: [tt]_WILD:downloads:entry[/tt]. Usergroups could be ticked (checked) to deny members in those usergroups access to the website screen that actually views a download ([tt]type=entry[/tt] is that interface).\n\nAt the bottom of the same screen you can choose what error message to display if someone is denied access. This is very useful if you have a specific reason for closing down access to something that you wish to explain.

NO_JS_ADVANCED_SCREEN_PERMISSIONS=Unfortunately you do not have JavaScript support enabled in your web browser, which means this advanced editor can not function. You are now being redirected to a more primitive editor for page permissions; zone-level and category-level permissions need to be edited on the resource's own edit screens.
PERMISSIONS_TREE_EDITOR_HOW_WORK=How does this work?
PERMISSIONS_TREE_EDITOR_ABOUT_PRIVILEGE=This screen allows you to edit the permissions for any resource in the system. For the most part, this includes any category, module or zone.<br /><br />If you want to set defaults on a wide scale, or set other privileges (such as 'Can bypass the word filter'), then do so from the <a href="{1}">global privileges</a> editing screen.<br /><br />You cannot set permissions for super-administrator usergroups, as these always have full permissions.
PERMISSIONS_TREE_EDITOR_ABOUT_BARRIERS=For a user to see any given part of your website, one of their usergroups needs<br />&ldquo;{1}&nbsp;view&nbsp;access&rdquo; for it, and for <span class="comcode_concept_inline" onmouseover="if (typeof window.activate_tooltip!='undefined') activate_tooltip(this,event,'View access does not inherit. Instead, it works via a barrier system &ndash; there are certain barriers (shown in bold) that you need access through to get to a resource.','220px');">certain resources</span> above it in the sitemap (marked by bold text).
PERMISSIONS_TREE_EDITOR_ABOUT_GROUP=Some resources, such as galleries, have additional icons: ({1}). These icons &ldquo;fill up&rdquo; as you grant higher privileges (such as moderation).

If you need more input fields, click &lsquo;Save&rsquo; and more will be available on return to this screen.
PAGE_MATCH_KEY_MESSAGES_TEXT=You may attach your own access denied messages to match-keys here, so that if an access denied situation arises on a page that matches your chosen message will show.

JUST_PRESETS=Please note that there is only one overridable permission available here, and therefore the preset you have chosen is unlikely to be representative.
PINTERFACE_PRESETS=Presets
REPEAT_PERMISSION=Repeat for other groups
REPEAT_PERMISSION_NOTICE=Click on some blank space in any other permission row(s) to copy permissions to that row. Repeat clicking permission rows as required. Click the blinking button again to stop the process.

USERGROUPS_WITH_NO_PERMISSIONS=The following usergroups do not have any privileges associated with them and thus should absorb from the appropriate usergroup: <strong>{1}</strong>.

PERMISSIONS_FROM=Permissions are <strong>taken</strong> from this usergroup.
PERMISSIONS_TO=Permissions are <strong>placed</strong> into this usergroup (after first deleting what may be currently there currently).
