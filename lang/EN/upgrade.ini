FU_UPGRADER_TITLE=Composr upgrader
FU_UPGRADER_INTRO=This is the Composr upgrade tool. This tool is a part of Composr, but it is intentionally kept lightweight to keep it working even if Composr is partly broken.
FU_LOGIN_INFO=Once you log in you will be presented with some options to help you upgrade or perform maintenance on your Composr-powered website.
FU_LOGIN_INFO_PASS_FORGET=If so, find the <kbd>master_password</kbd> line of your <kbd>_config.php</kbd> file and put in a new temporary password (the one written there won't work because it is encrypted). Once you have done this you should promptly use the <kbd>config_editor.php</kbd> script to change the password, as this will save it again as encrypted.
FU_LOGIN_FORGOT_PASSWORD_Q=Forgot your password?
FU_CHOICES=The following choices are available to you:
WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED=<p>The following files may have been superseded by new versions, but you have overrides/customisations blocking the newest versions. Look into this and consider reincorporating your changes into our new version. If this is not done, bugs (potentially security holes) may occur, or be left unfixed. If you edited using an inbuilt editor, the file on which you based it will be saved as <kbd>file.editfrom</kbd>: you may use a tool such as <a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">WinMerge</a> to compare the <kbd>editfrom</kbd> file to your own, and then apply those same changes to the latest version of the file.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ALIEN=<p>The following alien files were found in Composr and possibly should be deleted. It may be that these files are remnants of the previous version or files from uninstalled addons (these ones are pre-ticked/checked), and they may cause problems if left behind. Please check each file to see what it is, and if you believe it to be an outdated file, delete it. Please take a backup first though!</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_ADDON=<p>The following files relating to non-bundled addons were found in Composr and probably should be deleted if you have done a major upgrade. They may not be compatible with the version you are currently running. If you delete the files you will be able to restore them by importing the latest version of the addons involved (Composr will help you with this from the Admin Zone).</p><ul>{1}</ul>
FILE_MOVED=A module file, <kbd>{1}</kbd>, was apparently moved from the &ldquo;<kbd>{2}</kbd>&rdquo; zone to the &ldquo;<kbd>{3}</kbd>&rdquo; zone previously.
NO_UPGRADE_DONE=<p>No specific upgrade needed to be done.</p>
AUTO_MERGED=[don't worry this has just been automatically merged using the <kbd>.editfrom</kbd> file, and a revision backup has been taken]
FU_UPGRADED_MODULE=Upgraded module <kbd>{1}</kbd>

FU_ALL_CHMODDED_GOOD=<p>All permissions are correct.</p>
WARNING_FILE_CHMOD=<p>The following files have incorrect permissions:</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_MOVED_MODULES=<p>The upgrader has detected that some Composr modules were probably previously moved. However because the new Composr files have been uploaded, the new Composr module files are back where they used to be. You therefore need to do the moving again, overwriting the old versions that were previously moved.</p><ul>{1}</ul>
FU_UPGRADE_MODULES=<p>Upgraded/installed:</p><ul>{1}</ul>
FU_NO_CNS_UPGRADE=<p>Conversr did not need to be upgraded.</p>
FU_UPGRADE_CNS=Upgrade Conversr
FU_MUST_UPGRADE_CNS=<div>Now you must {1}.</div>
FU_FTP_INFO=<p>If you need to do a file extraction or permission-fixing, then you'll probably need to enter <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> details below. If you don't need to do these, then blank out the fields (otherwise the upgrader will try to connect and fail if the details are incorrect).</p>
FU_UP_INFO_1=The on-disk version of Composr is <strong>{1}</strong> and the in-database version is <strong>{2}</strong>. This means the database is currently up-to-date.
FU_CLOSENESS=<span>(The website is currently </span><em>{1}</em><span>)</span>
FU_UP_INFO_2=The on-disk version of Composr is <strong>{1}</strong> and the in-database version is <strong>{2}</strong>. This means a database upgrade has not yet been completed.

FU_THEME_UPGRADE_FINAL=Go ahead and upgrade themes
FU_WILL_MERGE=This will attempt to merge in default theme changes to your custom theme CSS. This is not perfect, it will likely result in some small theme errors that you would need to fix manually.

FU_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO=<p>Whenever the developers make a new version of Composr, news is posted on <a target="_blank" title="compo.sr (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://compo.sr/site/news.htm">compo.sr</a>. Your Admin Zone will inform you and link direct to that news post. The news post will contain the URL to an upgrade file that you may use to update your site &ndash; feed that URL in here and the Composr upgrader will automatically extract it to the server, skipping files from official addons that you uninstalled.</p>
FU_FILE_UPGRADE_INFO_MANUAL=<p><strong>Important:</strong> This extraction step can be a bit precarious for large upgrades. If it does not finish correctly you can <a href="{1}">generate a personalised manual upgrader</a> of the latest version which you can extract yourself.</p>
FU_DRY_RUN=Do dry-run (show messages but don't actually do anything)
FU_DOING_DRY_RUN=Doing dry-run. The messages below reflect what would happen, but no destructive operations will be run.

WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ORIGINAL_AND_OVERRIDE=<p>The following non-overridden files are outdated, as are the corresponding overridden files (you can find the correct versions for the original in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running, but the overrides may still cause problems and might need removing/replacing):</p><ul>{1}</ul>

WARNING_FILE_OUTDATED_ORIGINAL=<p>These files are outdated (you can find the correct versions in the manual installer ZIP for the version you're running):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
WARNING_FILE_FUTURE_FILES=<p>These files do not match the ones bundled with your version, but claim to be newer (so these might be bug fixes someone has put here):</p><ul>{1}</ul>
EXTRACTING_MESSAGE=<strong>Extracting files</strong>. Please note that if execution halts without message during file extraction then the operation has not completed due to a timeout. If this happens (it can do on a small proportion of servers) try refreshing a few times to see if this works.
U_SKIPPING_MESSAGE=Skipping file (already up-to-date): <kbd>{1}</kbd>
U_EXTRACTING_MESSAGE=Extracting file: <kbd>{1}</kbd>

If the extraction doesn't progress, check to see if you have any browser addons blocking refreshes.
NO_DEFINED_THEME_UPGRADER=There is no theme upgrader available for the version you are upgrading to.
