DOC_CLEANUP_TOOLS=The website cleanup tools page will allow you to empty any website cache, as well as automatically locate and repair common problems, and remove any orphaned data. There are a number of cleanup tools, which are run individually; ideally none ever need to be used, but if things happen outside the norm (such as corruption, or bugs), they can be very useful.
CACHES=Caches
ORPHANED_UPLOADS=Find orphaned uploads
BROKEN_URLS=Broken URLs
BROKEN_URLS_FILES=(pointing to on-disk uploads)
BROKEN_URLS_404=(that returned 404 errors when retrieving)
MISSING_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were missing
MISSING_LANG_STRINGS_ZERO=Language strings that were bound to zero
FUSED_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were fused to multiple content items
ORPHANED_LANG_STRINGS=Language strings that were orphaned (unused)
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_LANG_STRINGS=The website software has advanced internationalisation support at its core: most content can be naturally translated into multiple languages. This support requires all language strings to be stored separately to actual content. This tool will detail and repair any problems in the link between content and language strings.
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_UPLOADS=The website software associates on-disk files (stored in the <kbd>uploads/</kbd> subdirectories) with content. This tool will list all the files the website software believes are on-disk, but not actually used. Please do not delete them without giving each individual consideration: it is possible that someone has manually placed them (or an unofficial addon has made them) and referenced them in a non-standard way.
DESCRIPTION_BROKEN_URLS=This tool is the opposite to the orphaned-uploads tool: it will find references to on-disk files for content where the files do not actually exist. The database records of the content will be detailed in a coded format, from which you can determine the resource type and the resource ID. This tool will also test non-local URLs for &lsquo;404&rsquo; errors.
ORPHANED_TAGS=Orphaned tags
DESCRIPTION_ORPHANED_TAGS=Remove any tags that have somehow ended up orphaned from any content.
LANGUAGE_CACHE=Language cache
DESCRIPTION_LANGUAGE_CACHE=The language cache caches strings for languages in a fast PHP-friendly format.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_lang_cache=Enable language caching. This will give a small performance improvement.
CLEANUP_TOOLS=Website cleanup tools
CACHES_PAGE=Choose what you would like to clean-up from the list. It is advised to only tick (check) the options you need &ndash; indiscriminately running all tools will not likely result in any net benefit, and will cause a temporary load-increase on your server.
CACHES_PAGE_CACHES=You may wish to rebuild caches after editing content outside the official website interfaces, or if cache files are lost or corrupt &ndash; however you should not ever need to rebuild caches if you have only been administering the website normally.
CACHES_PAGE_EXP_OPTIMISERS=Optimisers
CACHES_PAGE_EXP_CACHES=De-cachers
DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATES=Empty the templates cache (language, theme and site configuration information is compiled into the template cache).
IMAGE_THUMBNAILS=Regenerate image thumbnails
DESCRIPTION_IMAGE_THUMBNAILS=Erase all the thumbnails for your images.
COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode field pre-calculations
DESCRIPTION_COMCODE_CACHE=Comcode fields are cached in a pre-calculated format which is a cross between Comcode and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. In theory this should mean that changes to site configuration shouldn't damage the integrity, but some changes may do so.
SELF_LEARNING_CACHE=Self-learning
DESCRIPTION_SELF_LEARNING_CACHE=This smart cache learns what resources pages needed, in order to pre-load pinpointed resources in efficient batch operations.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_block_cache=Enable block caching. It is highly recommended that this option is left on for a production website, but while you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so that your changes are reflected immediately.
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGES_CACHE=Any mapping in the theme image mapping which is not a specially uploaded user-image. This will allow re-searching for URLs for theme images that have not been explicitly overridden in the image manager.
BLOCK_CACHE=Block cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comcode_page_cache=Enable Comcode page caching. It is highly recommended this option is left on for a production website, but while you are setting up a site you may wish to disable it so you can directly edit Comcode pages as text files on the server (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers). Disabling this option will also stop the correct titles of parent pages showing in breadcrumbs.
COMCODE_PAGE_CACHE=Comcode page cache
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_template_cache=Enable template caching. If you are editing templates manually (without the aid of the website software) and do not want to manually empty the cache for every change, this option can be turned off (in theory the software can track when you change the file manually, but sometimes dates can get confused between desktop machines and servers).
TEMPLATE_CACHE=Template cache
DESCRIPTION_BLOCK_CACHE=Purge the block caching, and also the persistent caching.
STATS_CACHE=Statistics cache
DESCRIPTION_STATS_CACHE=Certain statistics, such as total downloads and bandwidth usage are calculated on-the-fly, and/or regularly calculated. If these statistics have become inaccurate, you may wish to recalculate them.
MYSQL_OPTIMISE=Optimise/fix database tables
DESCRIPTION_MYSQL_OPTIMISE=This will tidy up your database tables to make your site run more smoothly.
TABLE_ERROR=Error found on table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}
TABLE_FIXED=When repairing table {1}&hellip; {2}={3}
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_cleanup=Website cleanup tools
CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Correct MySQL schema issues (advanced)
DESCRIPTION_CORRECT_MYSQL_SCHEMA_ISSUES=Programmers will often make changes to MySQL databases manually, but this disadvantages the software because properly written code will create additional structural metadata in the database that is used to provide a rich cross-platform way to query the database (used by the backup system, as well as broken image checking, and various other features). This tool will identify missing schema data and fill in the blanks; it cannot identify exact types so will try and intelligently guess and show the results. This tool will also detect various other kinds of inconsistency that could happen with incorrect upgrade processes.
MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE_1=The following queries will make the meta database consistent with the actual database:\n<code class="whitespace_visible">\n{1}</code><br /><br />We did not check against the expected database due to these issues. Manually check these queries and run what you are confident about. They could potentially be removing legitimate modifications you or a non-bundled addon has made.
MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE_2=The following queries will make the actual database consistent with the expected database:\n<code class="whitespace_visible">\n{1}</code><br /><br />There were no issues between the meta database and the actual database. They could potentially be removing legitimate modifications you or a non-bundled addon has made.
NO_MYSQL_QUERY_CHANGES_MAKE=No MySQL schema changes were required.
ARCHIVE_PAGE_BACKUPS=Archive page/file revisions
DESCRIPTION_ARCHIVE_PAGE_BACKUPS=Move all Comcode page revisions, CSS revisions, and template revisions, into <kbd>_old_backups</kbd> subdirectories.
DELETE_SEARCH_STATS=Delete logged searches
DESCRIPTION_DELETE_SEARCH_STATS=Also delete logged searches. This will stop searches auto-completing from searches run before the given date, but you have over 10,000 logged searches so likely will not have much impact.
URLS_CACHE=URLs cache
DESCRIPTION_URLS_CACHE=Empty URL existence and URL metadata caches.
