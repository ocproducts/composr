[descriptions]
DATABASE_HOST=A 'host' is a computer which holds something. In this case, the computer on which the given database is running.
FILE_BASE_EXAMPLE=Translate 'you' only.

[strings]
SUEXEC_SERVER=You appear to either be on a suEXEC server. That's great because it means your site will be more secure and you will not need to set the extra permissions mentioned in the installation tutorial.
RECURSIVE_SERVER=You appear to be on a server with permissions already set. This may be because you're on a Windows or Mac server and the <abbr title="Access Control Listing">acl</abbr>s are set to grant 'recursive access'. Therefore you will not need to set any of the permissions mentioned in the installation tutorial.
TROUBLESOME_WINDOWS_SERVER=You appear to be on a Windows server, without recursive <abbr title="Access Control Listing">acl</abbr> settings set. Read the <a title="Advanced installation tutorial (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="{1}">advanced installation</a> tutorial for advice.
INSTALL_SLOW_SERVER=This server appears to have a relatively slow hard disk, or is overloaded &ndash; we had to skip checking the integrity of the uploaded files as it was taking too long.
FTP_FIREWALL_ERROR=You appear to have a firewall on your server somehow preventing <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> data transfers that originate from the server. Sorry, you'll need to use the manual-extraction installer instead of this quick installer.
INST_POST_ERROR=The licence must be agreed to. If you did agree to the licence, then you may be running the installer from a URL that does invisible redirections that cause form data to be lost. Try variants of the installer URL with and without <kbd>www.</kbd> in it &ndash; if problems still occur, contact your webhost.
ADVANCED_BELOW=You may change the advanced settings below if you wish, but it is not recommended.
INST_SUBSCRIPTION_LEVEL=Subscription level
NO_PHP_DB=There are no PHP extensions loaded for database handling. At least one MySQL-compatible PHP extension is required. Please consult the system administrator of this server.
WARNING_DB_OVERWRITE=<p><span class="red_alert" role="alert">Warning:</span> if you are trying to upgrade your current Composr installation, <strong class="up_alert">stop here</strong>. By continuing with this installation, you will overwrite the database of your current installation and destroy any customised or uploaded files stored on disk. That previous installation (if still present) will <strong>not</strong> continue to function and will be <strong>irretrievable</strong> without backups.</p><p>If you are trying to upgrade your Composr installation, use the <strong>upgrader.php</strong> script from the new version, as instructed in our <a target="_blank" href="{1}">upgrading tutorial</a>. The installer and installer archive files are never involved in an upgrade.</p><p><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Only</span> proceed if you're prepared to overwrite your current Composr installation.</p>
FORUM_BASE_URL_UNCHANGED=You have not changed the forum base URL. If this URL is incorrect, aspects of your system will malfunction. Are you sure you wish to proceed?
FORUM_BASE_URL_INVALID=You may not install Composr into the same directory as your forum.
CORRUPT_FILES_LOWERCASE=Some of your filenames have lost their case. It is crucial that you do not pass Composr's files through a process that can lead to this, as Composr treats files with case sensitivity.
CORRUPT_FILES_CROP=Some of Composr's filenames have been cropped. You have most likely extracted them using an old operating system. Composr cannot survive this.
MISSING_INSTALLATION_FILE=A Composr file, <kbd>{1}</kbd> is missing &ndash; it needs to be uploaded.
CORRUPT_INSTALLATION_FILE=A Composr file, <kbd>{1}</kbd> is corrupt &ndash; it needs to be re-uploaded (ignore this if the file has been intentionally edited).
_MISSING_INSTALLATION_FILE=There are <strong>{1}</strong> missing Composr files that need to be uploaded:
_CORRUPT_INSTALLATION_FILE=There are <strong>{1}</strong> corrupt Composr files that need to be uploaded:
INSTALLED_CNS=Installed Conversr (the Composr forum)
INSTALLED_MODULE=Installed module <kbd>{1}</kbd>
INSTALLED_BLOCK=Installed block <kbd>{1}</kbd>
INSTALLED_ADDON=Installed <kbd>{1}</kbd>
CREATED_CUSTOM_PROFILE_FIELDS=Created custom profile fields
CHMOD_PASS=CHMODing worked
CHMOD_FAIL=CHMODing failed. This may be because the server might be running Microsoft Windows. If your server is setup to allow write access by default, this is fine. Otherwise you will need to perform CHMODing according to the installation tutorial.
PRIMARY_CORE_INSTALLED=The primary part of the core system has been installed
SECONDARY_CORE_INSTALLED=The secondary part of the core system has been installed
COOKIE_SETTINGS=Cookie settings (advanced)
USE_MSN=Do you intend to join a network of multiple Composr sites sharing a forum (you will need access to the shared <abbr title="Database">DB</abbr>)?
USE_MULTI_DB=Do you intend to have your forum and portal data each in different databases (third party forums only)?
REQUIRES_MORE_INFO=(requires more information)
ADMIN_USERNAME=Administration account username
DESCRIPTION_ADMIN_USERNAME=The username with which the first user account will be created. (i.e. your username).
ADMIN_USERS_PASSWORD=Administration account password
DESCRIPTION_ADMIN_USERS_PASSWORD=Choose a password for the above account.
CLEAR_EXISTING_FORUMS_ON_INSTALL=Clear existing forums on install
DESCRIPTION_CLEAR_EXISTING_FORUMS_ON_INSTALL=Type &lsquo;yes&rsquo; if you wish to erase the contents of this forum (if it does not already exist, it will be created, and this option doesn't matter). Conversr forums (and users and usergroups) may be shared between many sites.
BOARD_INSTALL_NUMBER=Board install number
VB_UNIQUE_ID=Licence number
VB_UNIQUE_ID_DESCRIP=This is your licence number which came with vBulletin. It is at the top of all vBulletin source files.
NO_PHP_FTP=Unfortunately your server's installation of PHP does not have <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> ability. You must either choose the manual installer or petition your webhost to provide this facility.
ADVERTISE_ON_COMPOSR=I do not mind being listed on compo.sr as a featured user
EMAIL_NEWSLETTER=If you would like to sign up to our (English) newsletter, enter your e-mail address and choose an interest level. You may change your preferences via compo.sr at any time.<br /><br />If you choose &ldquo;Interesting updates&rdquo; or &ldquo;Any and all updates&rdquo; then you may also receive some automatic guide e-mails designed to introduce you slowly to Composr.
MASTER_PASSWORD=Master password
FTP_USERNAME=FTP username
FTP_PASSWORD=FTP password
FTP_DOMAIN=FTP hostname
FTP_DOMAIN_NOT_LIKE_THIS=The FTP domain name should not include <kbd>ftp://</kbd> or any other special syntax. It is the IP address or domain name of the server (e.g. <kbd>example.com</kbd>).
FTP_DIRECTORY=FTP directory
NO_FTP_ACCESS=We could connect to the FTP, but we received an access denied error
NO_FTP_DIR=The FTP directory that was given is not valid; you likely entered the wrong FTP path. The FTP directory must be the same as that in which the installer is located. You may be able to find the path by looking at the path displayed in your FTP software (or the path component of the FTP URL if you uploaded using a web browser). If you can not get the quick installer to work, you may need to consider using the manual installer instead [Full error: {1}. Case: {2}]
NO_FTP_CONNECT=Cannot connect to the FTP server (if you are running on a non-standard port, try specifying this with a colon and then the port name)
NO_FTP_LOGIN=Could not login to the FTP server [{1}] (if you are running on a non-standard port, try specifying this with a colon and then the port name)
FTP_FOLDER=This should be the <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> path on the server of the directory from which this installer is running. Common examples: <kbd>/</kbd>, <kbd>/httpdocs/</kbd>, <kbd>/(installdir)/</kbd>, <kbd>/httpdocs/(installdir)/</kbd>, <kbd>/subdomains/(subdomain)/httpdocs/</kbd>, <kbd>/subdomains/(subdomain)/(installdir)/</kbd>, or <kbd>/httpdocs/subdomains/(subdomain)/(installdir)/</kbd>. Sometimes 'public_html' or 'htdocs' is used instead of 'httpdocs'.
AUTO_INSTALL=You are using the self-contained installation Composr package. In order to install from this, you must give your FTP details so that the package may transfer your files with the correct permissions.
MANUAL_CHMOD_TMP_FILE=You need to manually grant full write and directory access permission to the temporary directory that has been created on your web server. If it already has these permissions, try assigning them to its parent directory also (known problem on Rackspace Cloud service). Unfortunately the installer has not been able to automate this.
INSTALLER={1} installer
INSTALLER_STEP=step {1} of {2}
TERMS=By installing Composr you agree to the terms in the licence.
WELCOME_A=You will now start choosing settings. The {1} will explain more detail about how to set things up on the server/hosting, such as databases.
WELCOME_B=installation tutorial
CAREFUL=With the exception of the &lsquo;(No Forums or members)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Composr's own forum&rsquo; choices, this forum software must already be installed. This installer will leave your separate forum database untouched (if you are using a forum driver that uses one), with the small exception that some member account changes are made.
ADVANCED_DATABASE_SETUP=Advanced database/site-network configurations
DB_CHOICE=<strong>Advanced</strong>. Your database software (must be on the/a server).
FORUM_CHOICE=Indicate the forum/membership system you intend to use for your site below. We recommend you stick with our built-in forum; we have bundled importers for all the forums listed here so that you can install with our forum and then import your other software later. If you do want to integrate a third-party forum you must decide now, as you cannot change your mind later.
FORUM_PATH_TEXT=In order for your forum's details to be automatically detected, you need to specify where it is located on the server. This is a full server path, not an FTP path or URL path. If it is installed in an obvious location (like <kbd>/home/whatever/public_html/forums</kbd>) we should be able to automatically detect its location, however if it's installed in a not-so-obvious location or if you know exactly where it is, it's probably best to indicate that now, to save you having to configure all details manually. If PHP is configured with <kbd>open_basedir</kbd> security then this won't work across domains/subdomains, and in that case you'll need to type your settings manually.
FORUM_PATH=File-system path to <span id="sep_forum">your separate forum software</span>
_FORUM_PATH=File-system path to your separate forum software
BASIC_CONFIG=Enter your basic configuration details below&hellip;
FORUM_DRIVER_NATIVE_LOGIN=Once installed you will log into Composr using your normal login. Make sure you use an administrative account (the definition of what this is different from forum to forum).
FOR_EXAMPLE=For example, {1}
TABLE_PREFIX_TEXT=The prefix your tables will be given. This allows you to have multiple Composr installations in a single database.
DOMAIN_EXAMPLE=example.com
USE_PERSISTENT=Use persistent database connections
USE_PERSISTENT_TEXT=This option may reduce the time your script takes to start, but may also tie up server resources. Check with your server operator that you may use this.
MULTI_LANG_CONTENT=Support content translations
MULTI_LANG_CONTENT_TEXT=Support language translation on content (i.e. multi-translation). Not recommended unless you need it as it will make the database structure more complex.
BASE_URL=Base URL
FORUM_BASE_URL_EXAMPLE=http://example.com/forum
BASE_URL_TEXT=The URL to the base of your installation. If you have multiple domain name variations (e.g. with and without <kbd>www</kbd>) then enter the one you wish to use.
BASE_URL_TEXT_FORUM=The URL to the base of your existing forum installation. The base URL must start <kbd>http://</kbd>.
BASE_URL_REDIRECTS_WITH_WWW=Any requests through the base URL you entered are being redirected to include "www." in them. Go back and correct the base URL to include "www." or change the web server configuration to not do this.
BASE_URL_REDIRECTS_WITHOUT_WWW=Any requests through the base URL you entered are being redirected to not include "www." in them. Go back and correct the base URL to not include "www." or change the web server configuration to not do this.
COOKIE=Cookie for user
COOKIE_EXAMPLE=member_id
COOKIE_TEXT=The name of the cookie that stores the member's member ID. Cookies are pieces of data stored on users' computers, in order to provide continuity between their visits (e.g. keep them logged in).
COOKIE_PASSWORD=Cookie for password
COOKIE_PASSWORD_EXAMPLE=member_password
COOKIE_PASSWORD_TEXT=The name of the cookie that stores the member's password.
COOKIE_PATH=Cookie path
COOKIE_PATH_TEXT=Only scripts beneath this URL-path on the cookie domain may access this cookie. This should match the forum value (if you are using separate forums), and should suit both the forums and the website. It may be left blank.
COOKIE_PATH_EXAMPLE=/
COOKIE_DAYS=Cookie days
COOKIE_DAYS_TEXT=The number of days for which cookies are remembered
COOKIE_DAYS_EXAMPLE=120
COOKIE_DOMAIN=Cookie domain
COOKIE_DOMAIN_TEXT=Only scripts with this domain, or a subdomain, may access this cookie. This should match the forum value (if you are using separate forums), and should suit both the forums and the website. It may be, and probably should be, left blank. The leading <kbd>.</kbd> has a special meaning and should always be included, unless the cookie domain is blank.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_EXAMPLE=.example.com
COOKIE_PATH_MUST_MATCH=The cookie path must either be blank or correspond with some or all of the path in the base URL (that path is <kbd>{1}</kbd>).
COOKIE_DOMAIN_MUST_START_DOT=The cookie domain must either be blank or start with a dot.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_MUST_MATCH=The cookie domain must either be blank or correspond to some or all of the domain in the base URL (that domain is <kbd>{1}</kbd>). It must also start with a dot, so a valid example is <kbd>.{1}</kbd>.
COOKIE_DOMAIN_CANT_USE=You are using a non-DNS domain in your base URL, which means you will need to leave your cookie domain blank (otherwise it won't work).
MEMBER_SETTINGS=Member settings
_FORUM_SETTINGS={1} settings
AUTODETECT=We have attempted to auto-detect these settings from your separate forum software installation.
DATABASE_HOST=Database hostname
DATABASE_HOST_TEXT=Usually localhost
DATABASE_NAME=Database name
DATABASE_USERNAME=Database username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=Database password
COMPOSR_SETTINGS=Composr settings
DUPLICATE=It is usually alright to use the same settings as for your forums. Only made them different if you really don't want them in the same database, or if the forum details above were to a shared forum in a multi-site-network (in which these details will be for your new website database).
DUPLICATE_CNS=This must be the same as the forum settings above unless the forum database you specify already exists as a live Conversr forum (i.e. you are joining it as a multi-site-network, and the forum database is the shared database while this is for your new website database).
DATABASE_VALID={1} database valid
INVALID_DOMAIN=Invalid domain name given
BAD_PATH=Composr is not installed in the given file base path
GOOD_PATH=File path valid
FILE_PERM_GOOD=Checked file permissions
INSTALL_WRITE_ERROR=does not have 666 (write) permissions or does not exist
WROTE_CONFIGURATION=Wrote configuration
FILES_TRANSFERRED=Files successfully transferred and CHMODed ({1} of {2})
TABLES_CREATED={1} {1|table|tables} created
FORUM_DB=Forum database
SITE_DB=Site database
INSTALL_COMPLETE=Installation completed
INSTALL_LOG_BELOW=The Composr installation log for step {1} is below
INSTALL_LOG=Install log
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_A=Congratulations! Composr is now successfully installed!
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_A_SUP=The final step is to delete this file (<kbd>install.php</kbd>) from your server. This prevents other users from running this installation script, which would allow them to delete your database. As a security measure, Composr will not work until you delete install.php from the server. It is also a good idea to change <kbd>_config.php</kbd> so it has standard file permissions for a PHP script, to prevent potentially malicious users writing into the file (i.e. remove world/group write access).
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_B=If you need to run this installer again, you will need to upload this file again, so you may wish to keep a copy of <kbd>install.php</kbd> on your hard drive.
FINAL_INSTRUCTIONS_C=Your Composr is not yet configured, which can be done at any time from the Admin Zone.
GO=Go to my new website now!
CONFIGURE=Configure my Composr first
THANKS=Thanks for choosing Composr!
CHOOSE_MASTER_PASSWORD=Choose a master password (this is used for configuration file maintenance: it is not attached to any username). Don't use the same password as your database password, for security reasons.
CONFIRM_MASTER_PASSWORD=Important: the master password is used for core configuration and maintenance access. Please store it in a safe and secure place.
PASSWORDS_DO_NOT_MATCH=The given {1} passwords do not match
PASSWORD_INSECURE=Are you sure you want such an insecure {1} password? This will leave your installation and webhosting wide open to attack. You should use at least 8 characters and a combination of lower case, upper case, digits, and punctuation symbols.
PASSWORDS_DO_NOT_REUSE=It is important that you do not re-use the database password for the {1} password, as the database password has to be stored as plain-text.
CONFIRM_REALLY=REALLY?
DOUBLE_INSTALL_DO=Please don't click the 'Install Composr' button twice without at least waiting a few minutes &ndash; otherwise you will get two installs running concurrently and problems will result.
FTP_FILES_PER_GO=Number of files per cycle
DESCRIPTION_FTP_FILES_PER_GO=The number of files to FTP to the server per upload cycle. The default of 1000 is fine for most servers, but others may malfunction (such as passing a blank file to the browser for download, or giving timeout errors, or showing just a blank screen) if it is too high.
PLEASE_CHOOSE_LANG=Choose a language
ONEWSLETTER_4=Any and all updates
ONEWSLETTER_3=Interesting updates
ONEWSLETTER_2=Important updates
ONEWSLETTER_1=Critical updates only
INVALID_FORUM_DATABASE=The forum driver can not find the forum software tables under the given database settings.<br /><strong>Are you sure you have the forum installed and gave the details correctly?</strong>
DATA_FILE_CONFLICT=The temp file the installer uses (<kbd>tmp/tmp</kbd>) is currently being written to by another process. It is likely that you have loaded this screen twice in quick succession, and a conflict just happened. Please wait a few seconds before clicking 'Refresh'/'Reload' to try again.
AUTO_IN=automatic in
MSN_FORUM_DB_NOT_CNS_ALREADY=You specified different site and forum/member databases, and chose to run the Composr inbuilt forum/member system, but the forum/member database is not pointing to a valid pre-existing Composr installation. If you specify separate settings for these then it must be, as you are telling Composr to join the pre-existing network around that shared member database.
MOST_DEFAULT=Most people use the default
GAE_APPLICATION=App Engine application ID
DESCRIPTION_GAE_APPLICATION=The application ID you will be using on GAE. It must be lower-case, without any special symbols. <a title="Set up application on GAE (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="https://appengine.google.com/">Set&nbsp;up&nbsp;application&nbsp;on&nbsp;GAE</a>.
DATABASE_SETTINGS=Database settings
DEV_DATABASE_SETTINGS=Database settings (local MySQL install on development server)
DEV_DATABASE_SETTINGS_HELP=The defaults here are usually fine. Assuming you connect with the root account (which usually by default has a blank password), the database with the given name will be automatically set up by the installer. If other people have network access or physical access to your machine, you should set it up securely (set up a new MySQL user and set up the database manually with access for that user).
LIVE_DATABASE_SETTINGS=Database settings (Google Cloud SQL on live application)
LIVE_DATABASE_SETTINGS_HELP=Set up Google Cloud SQL <a title="Google Cloud Console (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Google Cloud Console</a> under your project, and complete the details here. This requires some careful setup, so read the Composr Google App Engine tutorial first. The username and password can usually be left as-is, as those are the defaults and Google manages application/database connection security elsewhere. The database host can be left as is, so long as the name of the Google Cloud Platform project and the Cloud SQL instance match the name of your application. The database name must correspond to the name you choose when you create your live database, which needs doing manually from the SQL Prompt (<kbd>CREATE DATABASE &lt;application&gt;</kbd>).
GAE_BUCKET_NAME=Google Cloud Storage bucket name
DESCRIPTION_GAE_BUCKET_NAME=The name of the bucket you have created in the <a title="Google Cloud Console (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/console">Google Cloud Console</a> under your project. This requires some careful setup, so read the Composr Google App Engine tutorial first.
