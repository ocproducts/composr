DOC_BACKUPS=In this day and age, everyone who uses a computer should know the necessity of taking backups. It is an absolutely crucial chore, and if you do not do it, you risk losing all your data, much of which you could never hope to recreate if you run a community website.\n\nMany events could lead to the destruction of your data, including:\n - hard disk corruption (perhaps 30% of cheap hard disks which are under constant use develop physical corruption problems \[I made the statistic up, but based on my experience, it is about right])\n - fire or other physical disaster\n - accidental damage\n - malicious damage\n - accidental loss of files\n - webhosts going out of business\n - having a hard-disk seized (if for example the site is unfortunately hosted on the same web server as a police suspect)\n - bugs in software (it is possible the software contains bugs which could cause data loss, and we do not accept liability for losses due to this, as users should have adequate backups and it is impossible for us to test all software usage scenarios)
DOC_BACKUPS_2=Remember [b]don't just take backups, test them too[/b]!\n\nBe aware that [b]the software developers recommend using a proper webhosting control panel backup tool instead of this tool[/b] if at all possible. Webhosting control panel tools have the advantage of running with less restrictions, so are less likely to have problems with timeouts or memory constraints.

MAXIMUM_SIZE_INCLUSION=Maximum size of files included
BACKUP_README=This is a backup of a website taken on {1}.\nTo restore the backup:\n - upload the files to the web server\n - edit the _config.php if you have moved to a server with different database settings\n - load up the restore.php script by URL to restore the database.
