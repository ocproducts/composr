DOC_POST_TEMPLATES=Post Templates allow you to help members standardise the formatting of their posts. This can be especially useful in situations such as where you have a support forum, and with every bug report you require people to give you certain information. Simply creating a post template containing prompts for that information can ease the strain of support considerably.
