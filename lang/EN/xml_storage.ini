XML_STORAGE=XML data management
DOC_XML_STORAGE=[abbr="eXtensible Markup Language"]XML[/abbr] data management is a tool intended only for use by power-users who need to sync website data between a staging/development website and a live website and don't want to laboriously meddle with database rows (which the software's deep internationalisation support makes harder than usual).\n\nThe XML imported/exported is a custom format designed for this tool, and is based upon database contents.\n\nThe tool requires an understanding of database design as without expertise and care you could accidentally overwrite the wrong data in your database, or break links between resources.
XML_IMPORT_TEXT=Import XML that was exported from a website running the same version of the software. You can shorten and modify the XML as long as you do not break its conformance.
XML_EXPORT_TEXT=Export XML for another website running the same version of the software, or some other software that supports our data format.
XML_DATA=XML data
TABLES=Tables
DESCRIPTION_TABLES=Select whichever tables you would like to export (you may select more than one). Once your data is exported you are free to further cut down the XML, and you may find Diff tools useful for this (for identifying differences to past exports).
EXPORT=Export
NO_CHANGES_MADE=No changes made
UPDATED_IN_TABLE=Updated {1} record
INSERTED_TO_TABLE=Inserted new {1} record
DELETED_FROM_TABLE=Deleted {1} record
RECORD_IDENTIFIED_BY=Record identified by...\n{1}
EXPORT_DO_THIS=Your exported data is below. Take this data, and feed it into the XML import box on your target website (on the bottom half of the equivalent page to where you were just at). <strong>Take a database backup first</strong>. Power users will be able to change this data, to cut bits out, or to remove ID key/value pairs so as to import records into new IDs rather than overwriting.
