[strings]
DOC_SETUPWIZARD=The first thing you will want to do after installing the software is to configure the name of your website, and other key details. The Setup Wizard will do this for you in a few easy guided steps and thus it is strongly recommended that you use it at any early stage.
SETUPWIZARD_NOT_RUN=<p>You have not yet run the <a href="{1}">Setup Wizard</a>. The wizard will help you get your site going, including making a layout, colour scheme, and logo.</p><p>The wizard will also remove unnecessary bundled addons. Without this, you will probably get lost in the huge number of features.</p><p>If you do not want to run the Setup Wizard, you can <a href="{2}">remove this notice</a>.</p>
SETUPWIZARD=Setup Wizard
SETUPWIZARD_STEP=Step {1} of {2}
SETUPWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=Welcome to the Composr CMS Setup Wizard, and congratulations on a successful Composr CMS install!<br />This Setup Wizard will allow you to quickly personalise/corporatise Composr. Be advised that if you have already started to configure your website, some of your changes may be overwritten by this wizard. The wizard is only designed to be run once at the start of your website and anything that the wizard can do is a shortcut to what can be done elsewhere in the system.
SETUPWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE_ALT=The Setup Wizard has already been run once on this website. You may run it again if you wish, but it will overwrite many settings that have since been customised. You may also want to go and <a href="{1}">reinstall any addons</a> you previously removed so that any options relating to them become available again within the wizard. Like all Composr wizards, the Setup Wizard is a supplementary tool designed to avoid dropping you in at the deep end of Composr configuration &ndash; anything the wizard can do can be done, with a higher degree of control, elsewhere in the system.
SETUPWIZARD_SAFE_MODE=<strong>Safe mode link</strong>: It is a good idea to <a target="_blank" title="Safe-mode link to bookmark (this link will open in a new window)" onclick="if (typeof window.external!='undefined' &amp;&amp; typeof window.external.AddFavorite!='undefined') { window.external.AddFavorite(this.getAttribute('href'), 'My website in Safe Mode'); return false; } return true;" href="{1}">bookmark this link</a> to the safe-mode version. If a major problem develops when customising your site it disable <abbr title="Custom files such as: Comcode page overrides, new Comcode pages, Non-bundled addons, Themes, Customised language strings">your changes</abbr> temporarily. In the rare event that you need the link, note that it only works when logged in as a super-administrator.<br /><br /><strong>Getting help</strong>: If you need help you can click the <img class="vertical_alignment" title="Support button" alt="support button" src="{2}" srcset="{2} 2x" /> button in the footer to see your support options. Bear in mind that community support relies on volunteers (like yourself?) and that people with serious projects should budget for proper professional support.
SETUPWIZARD_2_DESCRIBE=<p>Composr is an extremely flexible system: it is possible to make sites that are completely unique in look and feel without programming. Immediately after this wizard your site will still look fairly generic but you will be able to further customise your site with more detailed controls.</p>
WHAT_TO_EXPECT=What to expect from Composr CMS
SETUPWIZARD_2_DESCRIBE_EXPECTATIONS=Composr CMS is built with 4 layers of control, all of which you have access to and all of which are fully documented; each successive layer provides more control, but requires more experience.<ol><li><strong>Unexperienced computer users</strong> will be able to create a generic but rich website.</li><li><strong>Experienced computer users</strong> will be able to create a highly featured website with its own look &amp; feel.</li><li><strong>Intermediate web developers</strong> with a good understanding of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> will be able to implement their own designs exactly.</li><li><strong>Experienced programmers</strong> will be able to create totally new website features, or modify existing ones.</li></ol>The developers have a lot of experience serving a wide-variety of users &ndash; we've thought about just about every feature that more than a minority would want and implemented it out-of-the-box, but the needs of some users are very unique, and websites increasingly complex, which is why we offer so much control as well as our own professional consultancy and support services.
SETUPWIZARD_3_DESCRIBE=Now enter some configuration details for your site. Some default values have been chosen for reference, but you will want to replace them with values of your own. In further steps defaults will also be chosen, but you are more likely to leave those later defaults alone.
SETUPWIZARD_4_DESCRIBE=Which bundled addons would you like to keep installed? If you selected an install profile then we have tried to choose the right ones for you. You can change your addon selection later easily from Admin Zone &gt; Structure &gt; Addons, so we suggest that if you don't think you'll want a feature that you let it get uninstalled to keep things fast and simple.<br /><br />Be aware that if you already created data and if you don't keep the addon associated with that data, that data will be permanently deleted.
SETUPWIZARD_5_DESCRIBE=What features and structure do you want?
SETUPWIZARD_5x_DESCRIBE=By default, Composr has two public zones (site sections): a &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; zone and a &lsquo;Site&rsquo; zone. This subdivision is useful:<ol><li>for presenting an isolated welcome page before users enter the main site</li><li>to force users to join your site (possibly by paying) before they have access to all content</li></ol>If you do not want to force users to join and do not want a separate welcome page, choose the &lsquo;Single public zone&rsquo; and enable &lsquo;Full guest access&rsquo;.
SETUPWIZARD_6_DESCRIBE=Specify which of a selection of available blocks (positioned features which fit inside a box) you would like on your front pages and panels. A default arrangement has been chosen, but it is likely you will want a different one &ndash; corporate websites tend to use far fewer blocks favouring marketing copy and minimalism, while community websites tend to use lots.<br /><br />Once the wizard is finished it's likely you'll want to tweak your block arrangement, changing block parameters for example. This is done by editing the page the block is on, clearing the code for a block, then clicking the 'Add block' button to add a new block &mdash; you'll be given full guidance through the choice of block parameters.
SETUPWIZARD_7_DESCRIBE=It is important for any website with a membership to have some rules, just like it is important for any real world community to have some rules. We have created some out-of-the-box rule sets for you to choose from, ranging from stricter rules that apply to a corporate setting, to very liberal rules (in that they are a lot less prohibitive) that apply to more freely expressive communities. For most websites the balanced rules are most appropriate. Composr also contains a privacy page which you may wish to edit at a later time.
SETUPWIZARD_8_DESCRIBE=Enter a colour around which your website theme will be built. Your theme will be based around the default theme, but in your colour. There are lots of other themes you can find to install on the Composr website, some free, some commercial, and many of these may also be changed to a colour of your choice.<br /><br />It will take around 20 seconds (depending on your server) to generate your theme, and this will happen on the last step of the Setup Wizard. Some servers have bad configuration and will terminate a script if it takes more than about 10. If this happens (you can recognise by a blank screen or an 'Internal server error') just keep clicking refresh/reload in your browser until it finishes. The Setup Wizard is smart enough to be able to pick up where it leaves off.
SETUPWIZARD_9_DESCRIBE=Choose whether to leave the website closed for now, or whether to open it to the public.
SETUPWIZARD_10_DESCRIBE=Congratulations, the Setup Wizard has now completed! You may now continue to work on your website.<br /><br />You may wish to add a few Comcode pages, and then add some dynamic content such as downloads. Also head over to your profile at some point to configure your e-mail address, choose what notifications you wish to receive, and to personalise your account.<br /><br />You'll find these tasks, and some more suggestions, on the checklist on the Admin Zone Status page.
SETUPWIZARD_RULES_balanced=Balanced rules
SETUPWIZARD_RULES_liberal=Liberal rules

DOC_CONFIGURATION=The configuration module is used to set most website options. The options are spread across multiple option categories, each containing option groups. Each of the options has a description underneath it to help you.\n\nMost configuration options do not need changing unless you want to divert from the default behaviour; the options that do need changing can be configured early-on using the Setup Wizard.
CONFIGURATION=Configuration
OPTION_CATEGORIES=Option categories
OPTION_CATEGORY=Option category
OPTION_GROUPS=Option groups

CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__ADMIN=Options for interfaces that only staff can normally access, such as the Admin Zone dashboard.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__FEATURE=These are either options for features that aren't tied to any specific addon, or options for addons without many options.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__POINTS=Options related to points (but not the Point Store).
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__POINTSTORE=Options related to the Point Store.
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__FORUMS=Options for the inbuilt forum system, including forums, topics, and posts.

DETECT_LANG_BROWSER=Detect language from browser
DETECT_LANG_FORUM=Detect language from account
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_lang_browser=If enabled, the language in which content is presented in will be detected from the language the visitor's web browser specifies. This is unreliable as unfortunately many people have misconfigured web browsers.
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_lang_forum=If enabled, the language in which content is presented in will be detected from the member's forum profile (if they have one). This takes precedence over detection from a browser.
UNZIP_DIR=Unzip directory
UNZIP_CMD=Unzip command
CONFIG_OPTION_unzip_dir=A safe directory path to which to unzip files. It is necessary to have this path outside the web root for security reasons.
CONFIG_OPTION_unzip_cmd=The command executed in order to unzip files. This depends on InfoZip being on your system; you may require a full path to the unzip command here.
MAXIMUM_DOWNLOAD=Maximum monthly bandwidth
MAXIMUM_USERS=Maximum users
USERS_ONLINE_TIME=Inactivity timeout
GZIP_OUTPUT=Gzipped output
MEMBER_FILTER=Filter group by website
FORUM_IN_PORTAL=Show forum within website
DISPLAY_PHP_ERRORS=Allow visitors to see PHP errors
SITE_NAME=Site name
SITE_SCOPE=Site scope
COPYRIGHT=Site copyright
MULTI_SITE_NETWORKING=Multi-Site-Networking
NETWORK_LINKS=Network membership URL

USER_INTERACTION_COMMENTING=User interaction: commenting
ALLOW_AUDIO_VIDEOS=Allow audio as videos
SEND_ERROR_EMAILS_OCPRODUCTS=Send error e-mails to the developers
COLLAPSE_USER_ZONES=Single public zone
CONFIG_OPTION_collapse_user_zones=Whether the Welcome and Site zones should be identical. Identity eases navigation and reduces maintenance, but removes the potential separation advantages (e.g. easily having a paid site).
CONFIG_OPTION_send_error_emails_ocproducts=Automatically e-mail stack dumps and error messages to the developers, to assist in fixing bugs promptly and with minimum hassle. If you are concerned about privacy from the developers, disable this.
CONFIG_OPTION_width_left=Enter the number of pixels for the width of the left panel.
CONFIG_OPTION_width_right=Enter the number of pixels for the width of the right panel.
CONFIG_OPTION_forum_in_portal=Tick (check) to have the forum always display within your website (this option won't have any effect if someone visits the forum by direct URL).
CONFIG_OPTION_forum_in_portal__cns=If you are using a multi-site-network, tick (check) this to make your forum appear to be running locally rather than having forum links direct to the central network site.
CONFIG_OPTION_maximum_users=The maximum number of users who may be concurrently using the site before &lsquo;busy&rsquo; messages start to appear (only staff may continue to use the website while it is in this sense &lsquo;busy&rsquo;).
CONFIG_OPTION_users_online_time=The time that has to elapse in minutes before a user is considered to have moved off the site (i.e. a user is considered online if their last page load was less than X minutes ago).
CONFIG_OPTION_gzip_output=Enable this if you would like to perform gzip compression on your HTML output to decrease download times, at the cost of raising server CPU usage. On a small minority of buggy servers this option is unsafe (if the server is already configured to indiscriminately apply gzip at a lower level).
CONFIG_OPTION_log_php_errors=Save PHP errors to the <kbd>data_custom/errorlog.php</kbd> file so that you may review them. The log can be viewed from Admin Zone > Audit > Error Logs. Hopefully no errors will ever happen.
CONFIG_OPTION_display_php_errors=Display unfiltered fatal PHP errors (errors the software cannot catch) for non-staff. PHP errors can potentially reveal server environment details; it is recommended this option be turned off when you have the website working satisfactorily.
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_server=The DNS name of the SMTP server.
CONFIG_OPTION_thumb_width=The width of the thumbnails produced. The height is automatically scaled to match this width.
CONFIG_OPTION_default_lang=The default language for this website's content to be displayed and submitted. It is overridden if a user chooses their language manually.
CONFIG_OPTION_cc_address=Only fill this out if you want to receive a copy of every e-mail the website sends to your visitors (this could be quite a lot on a busy website).
CONFIG_OPTION_comment_text=The guide text posted on comment pages.
CONFIG_OPTION_infinite_scrolling=Tick (check) this if you want to enable infinite scrolling instead of pagination. This is not available in all areas of the system, but is in most front-end content areas.
CONFIG_OPTION_super_logging=Tick (check) this if you want low-level details of every page hit to be logged. This is useful if you wish to view complete activity of any visitor, for purposes of analytics, debugging, or investigating security incidents. It does, however, use about 25% more database space.
CONFIG_OPTION_site_name=The name of your site (it will be used in many places across the software).
CONFIG_OPTION_comments_forum_name=The forum in which all comment topics are created.
CONFIG_OPTION_copyright=The copyright notice. &lsquo;&amp;copy;&rsquo; represents the copyright symbol. If you wish to automate an end date you can use <kbd>$CURRENT_YEAR</kbd> like <kbd>Copyright &copy; 2012-$CURRENT_YEAR=2016 ACME Corps</kbd> or <kbd>Copyright &copy; 2012-$CURRENT_YEAR ACME Corps</kbd>. The former will be automatically updated to the current year when posting new content (i.e. bumped forward only when posting new content within a new year), the latter will always be up-to-date (which is legally dubious if changes haven't actually been made, but some may be happy with that).
CONFIG_OPTION_closed=The text to display when your site is closed (in Comcode format).
CONFIG_OPTION_site_closed=Should the website be open or closed to the public?
CONFIG_OPTION_welcome_message=The text displayed in the welcome block (which is on the front page by default), to welcome people to your site (in Comcode format).
CONFIG_OPTION_site_scope=The scope (topic) of your site. This should be a very short phrase that may be embedded within a sentence. For example, a site involving chocolate might choose &lsquo;chocolate&rsquo; as the scope. The software may then use the scope in a larger sentence, for example &ldquo;We hope that this is the best site for <em>chocolate</em> on the Internet.&rdquo;.
CONFIG_OPTION_description=This appears beside your site name in search engine results for any content pages that don't have their own descriptions/summaries.
CONFIG_OPTION_keywords=A comma-separated list of keywords for your site (made available to webcrawlers which look on your site).
CONFIG_OPTION_network_links=The URL to your network link file if you are a part of a Composr CMS multi-site-network (otherwise irrelevant). For example <kbd>http://centralsite.example.com/netlink.php</kbd> (the <kbd>netlink.php</kbd> file is included as a part of Composr CMS).
CONFIG_OPTION_staff_address=The e-mail address to which staff mail will be sent (this is not used much as most messages go out as notifications, which are available individually to each member of staff).
CONFIG_OPTION_logo_map=This is an HTML-style image-map, which defines how your logo can be clicked; leave it blank if you do not need to change it.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_rating=Is rating of entries enabled?
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comments=Is commenting of entries enabled?
CONFIG_OPTION_session_expiry_time=The number of hours a session persists for without activity. A member not logged in with cookies, or using a session-requiring zone, will have to log back in after this time.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_trackbacks=Are trackbacks enabled? (Trackbacks are used for blog system interoperability &ndash; see the documentation for more details).
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_audio_videos=Whether to allow audio files to be uploaded in place of videos (for instance, in the gallery addon).
CONFIG_OPTION_max_download_size=The maximum filesize a non-staff member can upload (in kilobytes).
CONFIG_OPTION_cms_show_personal_last_visit=Show when the logged-in user was last active on the website (before his/her current session).
SESSION_EXPIRY_TIME=Session expiry-time
SHOW_INLINE_STATS=Reveal usage figures
CONFIG_OPTION_show_inline_stats=Whether to show figures on various areas of your website that indicate how often those areas have been used.
STRONG_FORUM_TIE=Strongly tie content to the forum
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_strong_forum_tie=When this is unticked (unchecked) forum comment topics are created when the first comment is added. When this is ticked (checked) forum comment topics are created as soon as content is added (so that the forum can be monitored to see what new content is added), and also posting a comment directs to view the forum topic.
WEBSTANDARDS_XHTML=Validate <abbr title="eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML5</abbr>
WEBSTANDARDS_WCAG=Validate accessibility (<abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>)
WEBSTANDARDS_CSS=Validate <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
WEBSTANDARDS_JAVASCRIPT=Validate JavaScript
WEBSTANDARDS_COMPAT=Validate for browser compatibility
WEBSTANDARDS_EXT_FILES=Validate referenced files
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_xhtml=Whether to check the HTML is valid XHTML5-strict, rather than performing just a structural XML check.
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_wcag=Whether to check accessibility (i.e. additional checks when checking XHTML and CSS).
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_css=Whether to check CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_javascript=Whether to check JavaScript.
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_compat=Whether to check for browser compatibility (mostly to make sure features not supported by old versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer aren't used). <strong>Not recommended because the core CSS will not meet these criteria, and because planned graceful degradation won't receive recognition</strong>.
CONFIG_OPTION_webstandards_ext_files=Whether to also check that external files, such as CSS, iframes, and JavaScript, are valid.
EXAMPLE_SITE_NAME=The website of defaultness
EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION=Serving all your default needs and providing a community for celebrating all that is default.
EXAMPLE_SITE_SCOPE=defaultness
EXAMPLE_HEADER_TEXT=Spreading the word of default
EXAMPLE_COPYRIGHT=Copyright &copy; 2016 default and default corps
EXAMPLE_KEYWORDS=default, defaultness, celebration, community
SIMPLIFIED_DONEXT=Simplified do-next scheme
CONFIG_OPTION_simplified_donext=Whether to adopt a simplified &lsquo;do-next&rsquo; scheme for administration. In this scheme, the adding/editing of an entry/category is succeeded by an immediate transition to the view page for that entry/category, and deleting an entry/category takes you to the home page. This is useful if the site is being maintained by staff without much knowledge of the software.
CONFIG_OPTION_anti_leech=Whether to enable the anti-leech protection. This prevents 3rd party websites from linking directly to files on your site, which could potentially use up a lot of your bandwidth.<br /><br />Beware this can cause problems for users on some ISPs, or users in some restrictive/outdated environments (i.e. images not loading for them). It will also create problems on multi-site-networks.
ANTI_LEECH=Anti-Leech
MAIN_FORUM_NAME=Primary public forum
COMMENTS_FORUM_NAME=Comments forum
COMMENT_FORM_TEXT=Comment form text
SHOW_CONTENT_TAGGING=Show content tags
CONFIG_OPTION_show_content_tagging=Show the content tags (links to search for related content) when you view content screens.
SHOW_CONTENT_TAGGING_INLINE=Show content tags (inline)
CONFIG_OPTION_show_content_tagging_inline=Show the content tags (links to search for related content) for items of content when you view certain content lists.
PERSONAL_SUB_LINKS=Subscription links
CONFIG_OPTION_personal_sub_links=Show account upgrade links (Conversr only). Links to all usergroup subscriptions will be shown to members who are not in any of the usergroup subscriptions you've set up and don't have Admin Zone access.
SHOW_SCREEN_ACTIONS=Show screen actions
CONFIG_OPTION_show_screen_actions=Show screen actions (for example, social media sharing links) when you view content screens. If you want to specify this per-page, disable this option then manually include the <kbd>main_screen_actions</kbd> block on individual pages.
FIXED_WIDTH=Fixed-width
CONFIG_OPTION_fixed_width=Whether the website is set to a fixed width, rather than scaling with the browser window. Fixed width is easier to design for (which is why many sites use it), but less flexible for the user (it is not responsive).
CONFIG_OPTION_main_forum_name=The name of the primary forum, where certain kinds of automatic topic are created, including &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; topics.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_su=Show a box that administrators can use to adopt (via su) the identity of other website members (for testing). The box usually displays in the footer, but placement of it (if any) is theme-dependent.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_conceded_mode_link=Show a link for members to concede their session confirmation, which forces a re-confirmation of their login if they are to enter certain secure areas of the website. This is a half-way house between staying fully logged-in, and logging-out, useful if a logged-in workstation is about to be briefly left unsecured.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_staff_page_actions=Show a drop-down list of special staff actions in the footer that may be carried out upon/with-regard-to any screen they are viewing.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_personal_adminzone_link=Show a link to their Admin Zone (if the member has access). On a default installation of this software, this link would also be provided in the list of zone links.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_top_button=Show a button that a visitor can click to make their browser scroll back to the top of the screen being viewed.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_STATISTICS=Show this in the &ldquo;Statistics&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_USERS_ONLINE_BLOCK=Show this in the &ldquo;Users Online&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_PERSONAL_BLOCK=Show this in the &ldquo;Personal&rdquo; block.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online=Show the number of users currently using the website.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online_record=Show the record number of users who have been on the website at once.
CONFIG_OPTION_activity_show_stats_count_users_online_forum=Show the number of users currently using the forum.
ALLOWED_POST_SUBMITTERS=Trusted partner sites
CONFIG_OPTION_allowed_post_submitters=This relates to your website's security features that prevent CSRF-hackers tricking users into submitting malicious forms (automatically or by deception), XSS-hackers performing dangerous AJAX calls (automatically), XSS-hackers loading dangerous Flash applets (automatically), or XSS-hackers loading dangerous JavaScript or CSS files. This field allows you to specify safe exceptions for partner sites.<br /><br />Each line is a domain name that is opened up to wider interactions with your own website.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_config=Configuration
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_setupwizard=Setup Wizard
SSW=Week starts on a Sunday
CONFIG_OPTION_ssw=Tick (check) this option if you want this website to consider Sunday the first day of the week (as opposed to Monday).
CONFIG_OPTION_root_zone_login_theme=Whether the welcome zone's theme will be used on any login screen, regardless of what theme the zone being logged into normally uses. This is useful if the themes you are using on individual zones are particularly private in some way.
CONFIG_OPTION_ip_forwarding=This option determines how HTTP connections from your site to your site, are made. Configure it if:<ul><li>your server has IP-forwarding and cannot directly connect to its own external IP address interface</li><li>a strong outbound firewall (i.e. you are blocked to your own domain's external IP address)</li><li>you are running off of a Windows computer name rather than a proper DNS name</li><li>local DNS resolution is broken for your own domain name (e.g. it is resolving to 127.0.0.1 but your network requests need to route through Cloudflare &ndash; in which case you need to enter the full external IP in here, not just <kbd>1</kbd>)</li><li>your server's outbound HTTPS functionality is broken, but you have an HTTPS site (in which case configure like <kbd>http://someip</kbd>)</li></ul>Otherwise, do not enable this as it could cause complications on some server configurations. If you enter <kbd>1</kbd> then HTTP connections will go to whatever the server thinks is its own IP address. If you enter an IP address then that actual IP address will be used. If you include <kbd>https://</kbd> or <kbd>http://</kbd> before an IP address, then that specific protocol will be forced.
CONFIG_OPTION_website_email=The e-mail address which e-mail will be sent 'from'. It is preferable for your e-mail to originate from your domain (the 'from' address being on your domain) so as to reduce the chance of it being filtered as spam. You should definitely ensure that the address's domain has no SPF record that prohibits your server from sending (such as a gmail address) &ndash; as this will cause many recipient servers to reject your server's messages as spam. Ideally you would create an SPF record that explicitly permits your particular server to send on behalf of your domain.
CONFIG_OPTION_bcc=Whether staff CC-e-mails should be sent as BCC (i.e. the people receiving the e-mails can't see that the e-mail is also CC'd to the staff).
CONFIG_OPTION_ip_strict_for_sessions=Whether sessions should be tied to IP addresses. Enable to increase tracability and security. Users with erratic connections (e.g. frequent changes of wifi zones), and users sharing accounts, will keep losing their secure logins if this option is enabled. We recommend that you keep this option enabled on production sites.
CONFIG_OPTION_eager_wysiwyg=Whether the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor should try and convert HTML to Comcode, and also clean-up markup, to make it readable. <strong>Not recommended</strong> if you ever hand edit HTML, as it will cause severe corruption to unrecognised HTML patterns.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_post_validation=Whether non-validated forum and Wiki+ posts/topics should count towards the total number of non-validated entries that is shown on the staff checklist.
CONFIG_OPTION_show_docs=Whether you want off-site documentation links to be displayed on areas of the website such as the Content Management zone.
CONFIG_OPTION_use_contextual_dates=Whether contextual dates (e.g. 'Today') should be used.
CONFIG_OPTION_enveloper_override=Whether to force the website 'from' address to be set using a command line parameter. Enable this if your server uses 'sendmail' for e-mail delivery, otherwise you should probably not enable this as it could cause problems with e-mail delivery.
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_ext_images=Whether to link to images in e-mails rather than embedding them within the e-mail itself. This reduces the data size of your e-mails (meaning they are quicker for users to download), and stops some e-mail clients showing all the images also as attachments, but it means that many users might not see any images until they click a &ldquo;Load images&rdquo; button in their e-mail client. You may need to enable this option if HTTP-loopback is restricted by your webhost.
CONFIG_OPTION_force_meta_refresh=Whether to use client-side (meta) refreshes rather than server-side (header) refreshes. Enable this if you are using an old version of IIS on your server, to workaround a bug in it.
SHOW_DOCS=Enable documentation links
SHOW_POST_VALIDATION=Tally non-validated posts
EAGER_WYSIWYG=Convert XHTML to Comcode
IP_FORWARDING=Work-around IP forwarding
ROOT_ZONE_LOGIN_THEME=Use the welcome zone theme on login screens
WEBSITE_EMAIL=Website e-mail address
ENVELOPER_OVERRIDE=Pass website e-mail address to 'sendmail'
BCC=Enable Blind CC (BCC)
ALLOW_EXT_IMAGES=Link to images in e-mails rather than embed
FORCE_META_REFRESH=Use client-side refreshes
USE_CONTEXTUAL_DATES=Use contextual dates
MAIL_QUEUE=E-mail queue
MAIL_QUEUE_DEBUG=E-mail debug mode
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_queue=Whether e-mails should be sent sequentially from a queue (by the system scheduler). Queue-based processing of e-mails will help smooth out system load, especially when a page request needs to send out many e-mails. A page request can trigger many e-mails if many members are listening on the same notifications.
CONFIG_OPTION_mail_queue_debug=Whether all e-mail will be held in the queue rather than sent, and you need to edit/force-send/delete items manually. This is very useful when first debugging a sophisticated website, if you are concerned e-mails might not be going out in adequate condition, or spurious e-mails might be sent. If you have this option enabled and then disable it, the e-mail queue will be processed quickly afterwards (so make sure you have deleted any inappropriate e-mails from the queue first).
CONFIG_OPTION_low_space_check=When the server has less than this amount of free disk space (in megabytes), send out a notification.
STATS_WHEN_CLOSED=Collect stats when closed
BOT_STATS=Log bot hits
CONFIG_OPTION_bot_stats=Include hits from bots in gathered statistics.
CONFIG_OPTION_stats_when_closed=Whether to collect statistics/log data when the site is closed.

CONFIG_OPTION_enable_keyword_density_check=Whether to provide a keyword density check feature, for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> purposes.
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_spell_check=Whether to provide a spell-check feature (this is not related to the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor).
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_markup_webstandards=Whether to provide an <abbr title="eXtensibile Hypertext Markup Langage">XHTML</abbr> checking feature.
ENABLE_PREVIEWS=Enable previewing
ENABLE_KEYWORD_DENSITY_CHECK=Enable keyword density check when previewing
ENABLE_SPELL_CHECK=Enable spell check when previewing
ENABLE_MARKUP_WEBSTANDARDS=Enable <abbr title="eXtensibile Hypertext Markup Langage">XHTML</abbr> checking when previewing
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_UPLOAD=These options control maximum upload file sizes. Maximum upload size depends on a number of factors:<ul><li>the PHP option <kbd>post_max_size</kbd> (currently {1})</li><li>the PHP option <kbd>upload_max_filesize</kbd> (currently {2})</li><li>the options here</li><li>and, usergroup daily-upload-quotas (settable when editing usergroups).</li></ul>
UPLOADED_FILES=Uploaded files
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_PERSONAL_BLOCK=The personal block is the block formally named <kbd>side_personal_stats</kbd>, and could also be known as the &ldquo;Login block&rdquo;. If you are not logged-in it provides a login form, otherwise it provides various options and details relating to your member account.
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_STATISTICS=The site statistics block is the block formally named <kbd>side_stats</kbd>, and provides information about your website. You will have chosen whether to use this block or not when you ran the Setup Wizard. It can be added and removed using the Zone Editor.<br /><br />Most of the options here are counts illustrating how much content is currently on your website.
CONFIG_OPTION_auto_submit_sitemap=Whether to automatically submit the XML Site Map to search engines such as Google.
AUTO_SUBMIT_SITEMAP=Auto-submit sitemap
INCLUDE_CMS_ADVERT=Include Composr logo

AUTOMATIC_META_EXTRACTION=Automatic keyword extraction
IS_ON_EMOTICON_CHOOSERS=Emoticon choosers
DEEPER_ADMIN_BREADCRUMBS=Extended Admin Zone breadcrumbs
HAS_LOW_MEMORY_LIMIT=Force memory conservation
IS_ON_COMCODE_PAGE_CHILDREN=Allow tree structures of Comcode pages
GLOBAL_DONEXT_ICONS=Provide CMS/Admin Zone icons after actions
CONFIG_OPTION_user_postsize_errors=Whether to show 'submission possibly too big'-style messages when the software detects a bad web request that could be due to an upload limit being exceeded. Disable this option if you are confident you have configured your PHP liberally and do not want to confuse users with reference to such limits.
CONFIG_OPTION_automatic_meta_extraction=Automatically extract meta-keywords/tags from the body of submitted content, via some simple statistical analysis.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_emoticon_choosers=Display a large sets of emoticon choices directly on forms. Disable this if you do not expect people to want to use emoticons very often.
CONFIG_OPTION_deeper_admin_breadcrumbs=Whether to show Admin Zone breadcrumbs that show what overall section you're in, rather than just the current position you are in a specific module.
CONFIG_OPTION_has_low_memory_limit=Enable this if you're using a server that has a low memory limit that cannot be overridden, but where PHP incorrectly (due to a modified PHP version) reports the limit as off ('1 &amp; 1' hosting accounts do this). This will put the software into a mode where it optimises itself to preserve memory, and instead be a bit slower.
CONFIG_OPTION_is_on_comcode_page_children=Whether to allow Comcode pages to be children of other Comcode pages, hence forming a tree structure. More complex sites will benefit from such a structure, although most sites will work just fine just being able to store pages under a choice of zone.
CONFIG_OPTION_global_donext_icons=Give do-next managers a set of general Site/CMS/Admin Zone jump icons, as well as contextual icons.
FORUM_CURRENTLY_UNSET=You currently have no valid selection for the '{1}' option. When you save this form, the Home forum will be used unless you set something different.
BREADCRUMB_OVERRIDES=Breadcrumb overrides
FIELD_FILTERS=Field filters
DOC_BREADCRUMB_OVERRIDES=Advanced facility for changing breadcrumb navigation structures using XML.
DOC_FIELD_FILTERS=Advanced facility for adding filters and restrictions on submitted forms using XML.
CHECK_BROKEN_URLS=Check for broken URLs
CONFIG_OPTION_check_broken_urls=Whether to check for broken URLs when parsing Comcode.
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=Google Analytics Web Property ID
CONFIG_OPTION_google_analytics=The Web Property ID for your <a target="_blank" title="Google Analytics (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> account (e.g. <kbd>UA-XXXXXX-X</kbd>), if you have one. This option depends on the Google Analytics markup not having been removed from the <kbd>HTML_HEAD.tpl</kbd> template.
INSTALLPROFILE=Install profile
DESCRIPTION_INSTALLPROFILE=You can optionally choose the closest install profile to preset your site with. This will choose sensible defaults for the rest of the wizard and also simplify your menus for a more compact/tailored navigation.
ADDONS_NOT_INSTALLED_IN_SETUPWIZARD=You have some uninstalled addons, which may be because you have run the Setup Wizard before. The Setup Wizard will have reduced functionality if not all addons are installed as it won't know about the services they offer. You can reinstall adons from <a href="{1}">addon management</a>.
CONFIG_OPTION_long_google_cookies=Whether to store more accurate Google Analytics tracking cookies. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
CONFIG_OPTION_remember_me_by_default=Whether to tick (check) the remember-me login feature by default. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
CONFIG_OPTION_detect_javascript=Whether to attempt to auto-detect presence of JavaScript using cookies or a redirect. This option is not ideal because it forces user-agents that do not have cookies enabled to go through a redirect when they reach the website. We recommend you leave it off as there is a bookmarkable link in the default footer to use the no-JavaScript version of the site for the tiny minority of users who disable JavaScript. <strong>As this technique uses automated cookies, it may not be legal in the European Union.</strong>
LONG_GOOGLE_COOKIES=Store full Google Analytics cookies
REMEMBER_ME_BY_DEFAULT=&ldquo;Remember me&rdquo; by default
DETECT_JAVASCRIPT=Auto-detect JavaScript
CONFIG_OPTION_mobile_support=Whether mobile devices are to be given special layouts, and detected by the software.
MOBILE_SUPPORT=Mobile support
COMMENTS_TO_SHOW_IN_THREAD=Thread comments to show
CONFIG_OPTION_comments_to_show_in_thread=The number of comments to initially show in a threaded topic (the most popular / earliest ones are shown first, and bridging ones that give context to those).
MAX_THREAD_DEPTH=Maximum thread depth
CONFIG_OPTION_max_thread_depth=The maximum depth of threaded topics. If people reply to a depth beneath this, it will be displayed using quote markup instead of by deepening the tree.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_feedback_link=Show a feedback form link in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_rules_link=Show a rules link in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_privacy_link=Show a privacy link in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_bottom_show_sitemap_button=Show a sitemap link in the footer.
CONFIG_OPTION_complex_uploader=If you want JavaScript functionality to be present. These advanced uploaders may not work well with all screen-readers.
CONFIG_OPTION_complex_lists=An advanced list selector (the select2 widget) which is sometimes not as user friendly for screen-readers.
CONFIG_OPTION_wysiwyg=If you want the WYSIWYG editor.
CONFIG_OPTION_editarea=If you want to enable the fancy HTML/CSS editor.
CONFIG_OPTION_autoban=If you want detected hackers to be automatically banned. You may wish to disable this if there is some kind of false-positive being triggered (there shouldn't be though!). Potentially hackers could use the hackattack system to get innocent people banned by directing them to malicious-appearing URLs, so if this ever happens, disabling this option could be necessary.
CONFIG_OPTION_js_overlays=If you want JavaScript overlays to be used instead of browser-based dialogs. The JavaScript overlays are good if you're either using a full-screen browser or tablet or mobile device, or if you don't like 'ugly' default extrinsic dialogs, or if your users have pop-up blockers set to disable browser dialogs. However overlays can cause big problems for some old screen-readers.<br />We recommend you do not disable this option as some modern web browsers are removing parts of their browser-based dialog support.
CONFIG_OPTION_likes=If you want to have simple like/dislike buttons instead of asking users to use a ratings scale.
CONFIG_OPTION_tree_lists=If you want to have JavaScript/AJAX-powered category selection lists. This is more user-friendly to sighted users who are adding content and essential if you have hundreds of categories, however is not so easy to understand with a screen-reader and keyboard navigation.
COMPLEX_UPLOADER=Complex uploader
COMPLEX_LISTS=Complex lists
EDITAREA=Enable code editor
JS_OVERLAYS=Enable JavaScript overlays
ENABLE_AUTOBAN=Enable auto-banning
ENABLE_LIKES=Replace rating with &lsquo;likes&rsquo;
TREE_LISTS=Tree lists
SPAMMER_DETECTION=Spammer detection
SPAM_CHECK_LEVEL=Spammer checking level
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level=The software has inbuilt support for integrating the <a target="_blank" title="Stop Forum Spam (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/">Stop Forum Spam</a> web service, for the detection and blocking of known spammers, as well as <abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr>s. This option determines the level of checking performed. Note that the Stop Forum Spam service is intended to be non-commercial, so if you have a for-profit site you should negotiate an arrangement with them. Note that most checks only work if <abbr title="The inbuilt software forum">Conversr</abbr> is being used.
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_EVERYTHING=Every page view (performs RBL checks always, and full check on actions)
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_ACTIONS=Actions (joining, posting, trackbacks)
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_GUESTACTIONS=Guest actions (joining, Guest posting, trackbacks)
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_JOINING=Joining
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_level_VALUE_NEVER=Never
STOPFORUMSPAM_API_KEY=Stop Forum Spam API key
CONFIG_OPTION_stopforumspam_api_key=If a <a target="_blank" title="Stop Forum Spam API key (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/signup">Stop Forum Spam API key</a> is filled in, automatic spammer reports will be syndicated (via the hack-attack system / flood-control system, when spammers are automatically detected). You will also be able to syndicate reports when you use the &ldquo;Investigate user&rdquo;, &ldquo;Action Log&rdquo;, &ldquo;Punish Member&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delete Trackbacks&rdquo; software features. You may manage your syndicated submissions on the <a target="_blank" title="Stop Forum Spam website (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.stopforumspam.com/myspammers">Stop Forum Spam website</a>.
TORNEVALL_API_USERNAME=Tornevall API username
CONFIG_OPTION_tornevall_api_username=If a <a target="_blank" title="tornevall API (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://dnsbl.tornevall.org/wiki/soapclient">tornevall key</a> is set up, enter the Username here. IPs will then be syndicated out like with the Stop Forum Spam service.
TORNEVALL_API_PASSWORD=Tornevall API password
CONFIG_OPTION_tornevall_api_password=If a <a target="_blank" title="tornevall API (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://dnsbl.tornevall.org/wiki/soapclient">tornevall key</a> is set up, enter the Password here. IPs will then be syndicated out like with the Stop Forum Spam service.
SPAM_BLOCK_LISTS=<abbr title="Remote block list">RBL</abbr> servers
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_block_lists=A comma-separated list of <abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr> servers designed for sharing spam blocking information. If you have an <a title="HTTP:BL key (this link will open in a new window)" href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/httpbl_configure.php">HTTP:BL key</a>, you may set up HTTP:BL by putting in <kbd>&lt;key&gt;.*.dnsbl.httpbl.org</kbd> (put it first, as it is the best data for web systems and will be prioritised if given first). Only certain servers are supported fully (unrecognised servers will work, but without any settings granularity, due to a lack of any common <abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr> standard).
SPAM_CACHE_TIME=Block list cache time
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_cache_time=The number of minutes to cache spam block list requests.
SPAM_CHECK_EXCLUSIONS=Spammer checking exclusions
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_exclusions=A comma-separated list of IP addresses to never check. It will also be impossible for IP bans to be run against these addresses, even if they are configured.
SPAM_STALE_THRESHOLD=Spammer staleness threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_stale_threshold=Only consider IP addresses that have been detected as malicious within this previous number of days.
SPAM_BAN_THRESHOLD=Spammer ban threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_ban_threshold=If spammer confidence is above this percentage then the user will be given an error message then immediately put into the software IP ban list (for the configured period of time).
SPAM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD=Spammer block threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_block_threshold=If spammer confidence is above this percentage then requests will be blocked with an error message. This only applies to requests that perform a content submission/join action.
SPAM_APPROVAL_THRESHOLD=Spammer approval threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_approval_threshold=If spammer confidence is above this percentage then bypass-validation permissions will be removed for the user.
IMPLIED_SPAMMER_CONFIDENCE=Implied spammer confidence
CONFIG_OPTION_implied_spammer_confidence=<abbr title="Remote Block List">RBL</abbr> servers do not generally support confidence levels. A suspected spammer will be assigned this level, which will then be compared against your threshold settings. The exception is HTTP:BL, which always has a confidence level of 0 or 100 (as it is very precise).
HONEYPOT_URL=Honeypot URL
CONFIG_OPTION_honeypot_url=If you have set up a <a title="Project Honeypot script (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="http://www.projecthoneypot.org/add_honey_pot.php">Project Honeypot script</a>, enter the URL to it here. The default theme has a spot where it will automatically be inserted so that you don't need to do it manually yourself.
HONEYPOT_PHRASE=Honeypot phrase
CONFIG_OPTION_honeypot_phrase=When setting up a Project Honeypot script, Project Honeypot gives lots of code examples to use. There'll be a random phrase or word in most of them: enter that here, or make your own up.
SPAM_CHECK_USERNAMES=Check usernames for known spammers
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_check_usernames=Whether to check usernames during the Stop Forum Spam check. This may result in false-positives if spammers were using very generic usernames, and doesn't really work as a reliable filter (it is easy to use lots of different usernames).
SPAM_BLACKHOLE_DETECTION=Blackhole detection
CONFIG_OPTION_spam_blackhole_detection=If enabled, hidden inputs will be placed on all submittable forms. No human would fill these hidden inputs, but bots would. If filled in, spam hack-attack alerts will be generated. If there are enough, automatic banning will happen, and information will be relayed to the Stop Forum Spam project (if an API key was configured).
FILETYPE_ICONS=Show file-type icons
CONFIG_OPTION_filetype_icons=Show file-type icons next to links pointing to documents.
DEFAULT_VIDEO_WIDTH=Default video width
DEFAULT_VIDEO_HEIGHT=Default video height
CDN=Content Delivery Network
CONFIG_OPTION_cdn=Set this to a comma-separated list of domain name you'd like CSS and images to run from. A random name will be taken for each CSS file/image. You need to upload the images to all CDN machines or (advanced) you will want some kind of automatic file mirroring such as an rsync setup or a software implementation via 'sync_file'.
URL_SCHEME=URL Scheme
CONFIG_OPTION_url_scheme=The URL Scheme to use. Note that for anything other than &ldquo;Raw PHP-style URLs&rdquo; you'll need a rewrite facility on the server and to be confident that it will remain working at all times. For Apache, this means <kbd>mod_rewrite</kbd>. The &ldquo;Raw PHP-style URLs&rdquo; setting is the simplest and safest, but also the ugliest, and may have a negative <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> impact.<br /><br />The &ldquo;Use .htm to identify CMS pages&rdquo; and The &ldquo;Very simple unadorned URLs&rdquo; options only work if your website is on the root of your domain name or you have configured a <kbd>RewriteBase</kbd>. In addition, whenever you add a new zone (or rename one) you must make changes to your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file (or <abbr title="Microsoft Internet Information Server">IIS</abbr> equivalent) to include it in the patterns, and you may not use any pages that share the same name as a zone. The &ldquo;Very simple unadorned URLs&rdquo; setting requires rewrite rules to be uncommented from the <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file.
CONFIG_OPTION_url_scheme_VALUE_RAW=Raw PHP-style URLs
CONFIG_OPTION_url_scheme_VALUE_PG=Use /pg/ to identify CMS pages
CONFIG_OPTION_url_scheme_VALUE_HTM=(Expert-users) Use .htm to identify CMS pages
CONFIG_OPTION_url_scheme_VALUE_SIMPLE=(Very-expert-users) Very simple unadorned URLs
BEFORE_MOD_REWRITE=Before you may enable <kbd>mod_rewrite</kbd> (or equivalent) support, you must enable it on the web server. If you used the quick installer then the installer will have tried to set this up for you in the <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file but did not manage it. This probably means that changes will need doing to the central server configuration. If you wish to try to change your <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file manually, look at <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd> or <kbd>plain.htaccess</kbd>.
URL_MONIKERS_ENABLED=URL monikers enabled
CONFIG_OPTION_url_monikers_enabled=Whether textual identifiers should be used in content/category URLs, instead of numeric IDs. Note that this option may have security ramifications (it makes content titles publicly available).
MODAL_USER=Modal user
CONFIG_OPTION_modal_user=Normally access around your website is controlled by privileges. However, certain actions by a member may result in leaking of public titles of content that other users may not normally have access to. This option specifies the user that will be used as a permissions-reference in deciding whether to allow this to happen or not. Leave it blank for it to be the Guest user, i.e. fully strict. Otherwise set it to the username of a member that has low permissions, but perhaps slightly higher than a guest might. Finally, if you don't care about the security of content titles, set it to <kbd>&lt;self&gt;</kbd> to indicate that checking is only performed against the member who may initiate the leak.
CONFIG_OPTION_attachment_default_width=The width that attached videos will be shown with, if no width is specified.
CONFIG_OPTION_attachment_default_height=The height that attached videos will be shown with, if no height is specified.
BRUTE_FORCE=Brute-force cracking prevention
NETWORKING=Networking
PASSWORD_COOKIES=Use password cookies
CONFIG_OPTION_password_cookies=Whether to enable password cookies. Without password cookies, members would be forced to re-login each time they visit or their session expires.
HACK_BAN_THRESHOLD=Hack-attack ban threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_hack_ban_threshold=The number of detected hack-attempts before automatic banning happens (default: 5). Note that not all detected attempts are real; in rare cases there may be a bug, or very commonly it may be a poorly written bot.
BRUTE_FORCE_THRESHOLD=Brute-force login threshold
CONFIG_OPTION_brute_force_threshold=The number of failed logins, to generate a hack-attack notice.
BRUTE_FORCE_LOGIN_MINUTES=Brute-force login minutes
CONFIG_OPTION_brute_force_login_minutes=The number of minutes through which failed logins will be counted.
BRUTE_FORCE_INSTANT_BAN=Brute-force login instant-ban
CONFIG_OPTION_brute_force_instant_ban=Whether brute-force password detection should result in an instant ban, as opposed to just one further hack-attack notch.
COMMENT_TOPIC_SUBJECT=Comment topic subjects
CONFIG_OPTION_comment_topic_subject=Whether comment topic posts should have an optional subject line.
DEFAULT_COMMENT_SORT_ORDER=Comment topic sort order
CONFIG_OPTION_default_comment_sort_order=The default sort order for comment topics.
CONFIG_OPTION_default_comment_sort_order_VALUE_newest=Newest
CONFIG_OPTION_default_comment_sort_order_VALUE_oldest=Oldest
CONFIG_OPTION_default_comment_sort_order_VALUE_relevance=Relevance

ENABLE_ANIMATIONS=Enable animations
CONFIG_OPTION_breadcrumb_crop_length=The maximum number of characters to include in a breadcrumb segment.
BREADCRUMB_CROP_LENGTH=Breadcrumb segment length
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_staff_notes=Whether to enable staff notes, i.e. when you add/edit content, you can specify to attach some notes to it.
ENABLE_STAFF_NOTES=Enable staff notes
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_theme_img_buttons=Whether to enable theme image edit buttons that appear to staff when hovering over theme images.
ENABLE_THEME_IMG_BUTTONS=Theme image edit buttons
CONFIG_OPTION_call_home=Whether to enable the private registration of your website URL to the software developers when the Admin Zone front page loads. This is used to monitor product usage with a view to locating areas for future improvement.
CALL_HOME=Register with software developers
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_seo_fields=Whether to enable meta keyword and description fields specified individually for each content item.
ENABLE_SEO_FIELDS=Enable SEO fields
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_seo_fields_VALUE_yes=Yes
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_seo_fields_VALUE_no=No
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_seo_fields_VALUE_only_on_edit=Only when editing (not adding)
CONFIG_OPTION_force_local_temp_dir=Whether your server has a problem creating/deleting temporary files in the system directory. If enabled, the local <kbd>safe_mode_temp</kbd> directory will be used for temporary files.
FORCE_LOCAL_TEMP_DIR=Segregated temp-directory
CONFIG_OPTION_jpeg_quality=Desired JPEG quality level, for any JPEG thumbnails that are created. It should be a value between 0 and 100. Thumbnails are generated in the same image format as the source images; i.e. a JPEG source image would have a JPEG thumbnail.
JPEG_QUALITY=JPEG quality level
CONFIG_OPTION_proxy=The hostname/IP-address of the machine acting as an HTTP proxy server. Usually you will not be behind a proxy server, so leave this blank.
PROXY=Proxy server hostname
CONFIG_OPTION_proxy_port=The port name of your HTTP proxy.
PROXY_PORT=Proxy server port
CONFIG_OPTION_proxy_user=The authentication username for your HTTP proxy (if you do not set it, no authentication will be used).

MAX_MONIKER_LENGTH=URL moniker segment length
CONFIG_OPTION_google_translate_api_key=The google translate API key for the content translation feature to work via automatic translation.
GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY=Google translate API key
CONFIG_OPTION_cleanup_files=Whether files linked to content that a non-staff member deletes should be deleted (if disabled, the software won't, for record-keeping/safety purpose, and because available disk space is usually much higher than the average site needs).
CLEANUP_FILES=Delete files for deleted content
CONFIG_OPTION_edit_under=Whether to let the edit screens to open underneath the choose-what-to-edit screens. This involves a more complex layout (harder to theme), but makes moving between editable entries easier.
EDIT_UNDER=Open edit screens downwards
CONFIG_OPTION_use_true_from=Whether to send e-mails 'from' the user that triggered the message, rather than the website. Usually it is set to 'from' the server to avoid problems with spam filters and uses the true sender address as the 'reply from' address. It is not recommended you turn this on, although it does aid usability if you know the recipient is not using SPF in their spam filter.
USE_TRUE_FROM=Use true 'from' address
CONFIG_OPTION_enable_feedback=Whether to enable the feedback features (comments, ratings, etc).
ENABLE_FEEDBACK=Feedback features
CONFIG_OPTION_session_prudence=Whether new guests from the same IP address as an existing guest session should be reinitiated with that session, and that sessions should not be saved to the persistent cache. This is useful to improve performance slightly if a lot of sessions are being utilised (particular by poorly-coded bots) yet eCommerce features that rely on tight session reliability for guests are not needed.
SESSION_PRUDENCE=Reduce session quantity
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_own_rate=Whether to allow members to rate their own content.
ALLOW_OWN_RATE=Members may rate own content
CONFIG_OPTION_general_safety_listing_limit=The general safety listing limit used throughout the site, to prevent very large index display bogging down your server. If this limit is exceeded it usually means an index within a screen will be omitted or cut short. Usually the software supports pagination, so this option only kicks in in rare situations.
GENERAL_SAFETY_LISTING_LIMIT=Safety listing limit
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_auto_notifications=Whether new members should be given a default to be notified for comments on their posted content. In other words, if a member posts some content, that member will automatically be set to monitor it for new comments. The default can be changed by a member from their own settings, as can individually monitoring states.
ALLOW_AUTO_NOTIFICATIONS=Auto-monitor posted content
DISPLAY_ELEMENTS=Display elements
GREETING=Greeting
LOGGING=Analytics / Logging
INTERNATIONALISATION=Internationalisation
BREADCRUMBS=Breadcrumbs
FRONT_END_PERFORMANCE=Front-end performance
CONFIG_OPTION_vote_member_ip_restrict=Whether members should be limited by IP address when voting. Guest users always will be, but if you enable this option, only one member of all members sharing any particular IP address will be able to vote. This prevents users creating multiple accounts in order to vote multiple times.
VOTE_MEMBER_IP_RESTRICT=Limit by IP address
FOOTER_LINKS=Footer links
CLOSED_SITE_OPTION=Open/Closed site
OEMBED_MANUAL_PATTERNS=oEmbed end-points
CONFIG_OPTION_oembed_manual_patterns=Advanced feature. A list of oEmbed end-point patterns, for websites that don't support auto-discovery, or websites we want to speed up oEmbed display for (by avoiding a discovery search).
OEMBED_HTML_WHITELIST=oEmbed white-list
CONFIG_OPTION_oembed_html_whitelist=A list of domain names where we will support unfiltered oEmbed embeds. Only list domain names you trust are not going to contain dangerous HTML. If a link is pointed to a URL on one of these domains, unfiltered HTML from that domain will be displayed on your own website.
OEMBED_MAX_SIZE=Maximum oEmbed width/height
CONFIG_OPTION_oembed_max_size=The maximum width/height for external embedded content.
ENABLE_LAX_COMCODE=Enable lax Comcode parser
CONFIG_OPTION_lax_comcode=Allow some tolerance in the Comcode parser, so that small errors are auto-corrected.
OUTPUT_STREAMING=Output streaming
CONFIG_OPTION_output_streaming=Immediately start streaming the output page, rather than generating it all then outputting it. This option only works where possible. Disabling the option may be useful for some programmers wanting to filter page output or perform non-linear operations.
HEADER_MENU_CALL_STRING=Header-menu call string
CONFIG_OPTION_header_menu_call_string=Either the name of a menu, or a call string identifying how to pull the menu from the sitemap (see the menus documentation for details).
CRYPT_RATCHET=Cryptographic ratchet
CONFIG_OPTION_crypt_ratchet=Represents how much work to allocate for password hashing (obfuscation), for new passwords saved into the system (e.g. new accounts, or if a user changes their password). A higher number means longer hashing time so is harder for hackers who've obtained hashes to back-scan and hence is more secure, but takes exponentially longer to verify each time a user tries to log in. Very high numbers may result in significant server slow-down when users log in. A sensible default is auto-detected at installation but should be very conservatively raised over the years as per recommendations for &ldquo;optimum blowfish costs&rdquo;. Note that this setting only affects newly saved passwords &ndash; it is impossible to retroactively upgrade old password hashes, or to retroactively downgrade password hash complexity if you set it too high &ndash; unless you force users to change their passwords.
IMAP=IMAP
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_IMAP=Settings to connect to the &ldquo;Website e-mail address&rdquo; e-mail account, via IMAP. Leave the password blank if you don't need to configure this feature. It is a part of the software's internal functionality, but out-of-the-box is only used for the optional e-mail bounce detection of the newsletter.
CONFIG_OPTION_imap_host=The IMAP server's hostname, typically both <kbd>localhost</kbd> and <kbd>imap.<domain-name></kbd> work. If your IMAP server is not the same machine as the web server you'll need to find the right hostname.
CONFIG_OPTION_imap_port=The IMAP server's port. The default is 143. If you use 993 or 995, then SSL will be used. If you use a POP3 port, then POP3 will be used instead of IMAP, but it's not recommended.
CONFIG_OPTION_imap_username=The IMAP username for the &ldquo;Website e-mail address&rdquo; e-mail account.
CONFIG_OPTION_imap_password=The IMAP password for the &ldquo;Website e-mail address&rdquo; e-mail account.
CONFIG_OPTION_imap_folder=The inbox folder.
MAIL_FOLDER=Mail folder
SECURITY_TOKEN_EXCEPTIONS=Pages without security tokens
CONFIG_OPTION_security_token_exceptions=On each line put the name of a page for which <abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgery">CSRF</abbr>-prevention will be disabled. CSRF-prevention works by enforcing passing of a secret code along with form requests, that external code would not be able to include. Disabling the prevention eases integration of external code with the software (which may not have session IDs available to them to pass along). The software has a secondary line of defence, referrer checking, but this may be disabled on some machines due to referrers being stripped by some security software.
ALLOW_THEME_IMAGE_SELECTOR=Enable theme image selector
CONFIG_OPTION_allow_theme_image_selector=Support choosing a theme image as an image source for category representative images. Usually you'll leave this on, but if you have the File/Media Library installed you may prefer to centralise around that and disable this option to reduce scope for confusion.
SIMPLIFIED_ATTACHMENTS_UI=Simplified attachments UI
CONFIG_OPTION_simplified_attachments_ui=Whether to locate the attachments <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> under a single Add Image button. This simplifies things on sites where users are almost ever going to be uploading images rather than other files. This option is not compatible with upload syndication hooks, if you happened to have installed an addon involving these (unlikely).
ATTACHMENT_CLEANUP=Attachment cleanup
CONFIG_OPTION_attachment_cleanup=Delete attachments when all references to them are removed. If you enable this option then you need to be a bit careful, as cutting, saving, then pasting elsewhere, would result in a broken attachment reference.
COOKIE_NOTICE_OPTION=Cookie notice
CONFIG_OPTION_cookie_notice=Provide a cookie manager/notice to users. This may be stipulated if you are operating from the EU or as an EU organisation, or possibly in other jurisdictions (check local laws). It definitely applies here if you have tracking cookies created by analytics or advertising software (such as Google Adsense). The software sets reasonable policies on its own cookies (minimisation, short/temporary-lifetimes, anonymisation, explicit opt-in, often staff-only), but the EU laws are written in very broad and vague terms and the developers cannot interpret them for you. The consent feature is powered by the <a href="https://silktide.com/tools/cookie-consent/" target="_blank" title="Silktide Cookie Consent tool (this link will open in a new window)">Silktide Cookie Consent tool</a>.
AMERICAN_ENGLISH=American English
CONFIG_OPTION_yeehaw=The software is developed in British English. This config option automatically makes adjustments within the bundled British English language pack for American English. It may not be perfect, so if you spot errors please report them as bugs. This option has no effect on other language packs.
DYNAMIC_FIREWALL=Dynamic firewall
CONFIG_OPTION_dynamic_firewall=Enable automatic download of new firewall rules from the central software server. These are maintained as an emergency measure if software vulnerabilities are found. This option requires the CRON bridge scheduler to have been configured.
CONFIG_OPTION_filter_regions=Whether certain content types will allow targeting of content to users within particular geographical regions.
CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRE_NEW=Token expiry in hours (new tokens)
CONFIG_OPTION_csrf_token_expire_new=The number of hours you can keep a form open before its <abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgery">CSRF</abbr>-token expires. These tokens prevent rogue sites tricking users into submitting forged web requests under their own credentials. A higher number reduces the chance of users getting annoyed if they leave a form open a long time, but it increases the risk exposure if somehow a hacker is able to obtain an active token.
CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRE_FRESH=Token expiry in hours (multi-use)
CONFIG_OPTION_csrf_token_expire_fresh=The number of hours a <abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgery">CSRF</abbr>-token remains valid after its first usage. You can set this to zero for higher security if you like, but it will stop refreshing and use of the back button to submit forms multiple times.
FRACTIONAL_EDITING=Enable inline editing
CONFIG_OPTION_fractional_editing=Enable inline editing of certain content fields, typically content titles.
KEYSET_PAGINATION=Keyset pagination
CONFIG_OPTION_keyset_pagination=Enable keyset pagination for result sets exceeding this number of entries. Keyset pagination significantly decreases database load but only allows pagination via clicking &lsquo;Next&rsquo; (rather than jumping in at deeper positions immediately). Keyset pagination is currently only implemented for forum topic browsing, as these result sets can be particularly large and crawled by search engines.
MESSAGE_RECEIVED_EMAILS=Send acknowledgement e-mails
CONFIG_OPTION_message_received_emails=Automatically send out acknowledgement e-mails when someone posts a contact message to the staff.
LOGIN_ERROR_SECRECY=Obscured login errors
CONFIG_OPTION_login_error_secrecy=Do not distinguish between a login problem due to an incorrect username and a login problem due to an incorrect password. This makes it a little harder to do brute-force attacks if combined with setting the "Restrict to one member per e-mail address" option to "Yes, and only allow login via e-mail address (more secure)".
BLOCKS_AT_TOP=Header blocks
CONFIG_GROUP_DESCRIP_BLOCKS_AT_TOP=These special compact blocks are included directly into the default global template and may be toggled on/off.
BLOCK_TOP_PERSONAL_STATS=Personal-stats
CONFIG_OPTION_block_top_personal_stats=Show a personal details button (connected to a details and links overlay) to users that are logged in.
BLOCK_TOP_LOGIN=Login
CONFIG_OPTION_block_top_login=Show a login form to users that are not logged in.
MONIKER_TRANSLITERATION=Moniker transliteration
CONFIG_OPTION_moniker_transliteration=Transliterate URL monikers to latin characters. This will make URLs tidier when written in code, but won't look as good in the address bar on modern web browsers that display URLs with special characters in an enhanced way.

DESCRIPTION_TIMEZONE_SITE=The time zone the site should report in. Note also that members have their own separate timezone setting.

DOC_BASE_CONFIGURATION=To change an option set during installation, you generally use the external "Installation Options editor".\n\nThe Installation Options editor is completely separated from the main software, so that if your site ever breaks due to a misconfiguration in the <kbd>_config.php</kbd> configuration file (perhaps if you moved servers, and your database settings are no longer valid), you can fix it without having to hand-edit the file. As a result of the separation, the Configuration editor cannot empty caches automatically when you change an option, so after using it you should use the cleanup tools to empty the caches.
BASE_CONFIGURATION=Installation Options
