[strings]
DOC_LOGOWIZARD=A 'Logo Wizard' is provided that will create you very simple site logos (the logos in the top-left of your website). It is recommended that you use this tool to create your initial logo and consider making your own customised logo at a later point.
DOC_THEMEWIZARD=An 'Automatic theme generator' is provided that will generate themes based on the default theme but tailored according to the parameters (such as colours) you define. This will allow you to create an individual look to your website, without going through the full artistic and technical process of theme generation. The results are of course limited (conversely virtually anything can be done using the manual themeing process), but good enough for many websites.
DOC_THEMES=Your website's entire appearance, from its layout, to its images, and color schemes all make up a 'theme'. These themes are completely customisable by you, given a moderate knowledge of HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

THEMES=Themes
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_themes=Themes
RENAME_THEME=Rename theme
IMPORT_EXPORT_THEME_HELP=Themes are transferred between software installations as addons. Shortcuts are provided above to export each of your themes as an addon. If you want to import a theme, <a href="{1}" class="must-show-together">import an addon</a> (come back here after you have done it and click the 'Edit theme' icon next to it to activate the theme).
EDIT_DEFAULT_THEME_WARNING=Are you sure you wish to edit the default theme? It is recommended that you create a new theme, and edit that, so that the integrity of the default theme is not affected, and can continue to function should you need to revert to it.
THEMES_AND_ZONES=Different zones (site sections: groups of pages) can be configured to use different themes. You have the following zones&hellip;
MANAGE_THEMES=Manage themes
ADD_THEME=Add a theme
DELETE_THEME=Delete a theme
DESCRIPTION_USE_ON_ZONES=Automatically assign this theme as the default theme on all zones (except the Admin zone and CMS zone). Note that leaving this action-choice unticked (unchecked) will not reverse the setting. To reverse the setting either:<ul class="compact-list"><li>each zone must be edited to select which theme to use (if any);</li><li>or, another theme must be edited with this action-choice ticked (checked).</li></ul>
USE_ON_ZONES=Use theme on all zones
TEMPLATE=Template
EDIT_THEME=Change theme settings
_EDIT_THEME=Change theme settings / make active / delete
DESCRIPTION_EDIT_THEME=Edit the theme settings here. Only the Title is made available to the public, the Description and Author are for your own reference (i.e. these aren't used as metadata for your site as a whole). Not every third-party theme will automatically be stable with all these settings, an unchanged Default theme (or Theme Wizard theme from the default) will though. The theme was created on {1}.
THEME_SETTING_SECTION={1} (advanced)
COPY_THEME=Copy theme
DESCRIPTION_COPY_THEME=Copy this theme to the given new codename, leaving the old one intact under the existing codename (<kbd>{1}</kbd>).
SOURCE_THEME=Source theme
NEW_THEME=New theme
ADD_EMPTY_THEME=Add empty theme
CSS=CSS
DESCRIPTION_AUTHOR_THEME=The author of this theme.
DESCRIPTION_ADD_THEME_MANUAL=Use this form to add a new empty theme. You may wish to consider the <a href="{1}">Theme Wizard</a> instead, if you'd like a new colour scheme automatically generated. If you'd like to copy an existing theme you'll find a copy option on its edit form.
THEME_ALSO_INCLUDE_PAGES=Also include the ticked (checked) Comcode pages in the theme. This is useful if your theme depends on certain block layouts, for example. Commonly you may want to export panel(s) and front page(s). The user installing the theme will get a choice whether to take your Comcode pages or not, and if they choose to their own pages will be backed up as the last revision.
EXISTING_THEMES=Existing themes
THEME_MADE_LIVE=The theme has been made live on public zones. If it is a basic new theme you won't notice any differences to the default though, until you make further changes to it.
SEED_IS=The random seed colour is #{1}.
THEME_MAPPING=Theme mapping
DESCRIPTION_THEME_MAPPING=You may map this theme to skins on your externally-powered forum. This allows automatic theme detection based on the forum-skin-preference of members.
THEME_EXPORT=Exporting/Importing themes
THEME_USED_ON=This theme is used for the following zones: {1}
THEME_DEFAULT_FOR_SITE=(<em>all that are unassigned</em><sup>*</sup>)
MEMBERS_MAY_ALTER_THEME=Members may change theme via their account settings; this will apply to any zone that has no pre-selected theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_SITENAME=This is the <em>site</em>-default theme as its codename corresponds to your site-name.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_FORUM=This theme is the <em>site</em>-default theme as it is bound to the forum's default theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_BY_DEFAULT=&ldquo;Default Theme&rdquo; theme is being used as the <em>site</em>-default theme as you have no theme with a codename of <kbd>{1}</kbd>. If you did, that would become the <em>site</em>-default theme.
DEFAULT_THEME_INHERITANCE=Theme files are taken from this theme if they are not defined in the active theme.
DESCRIPTION_CODENAME_THEME=The codename for the theme (this is used as a directory name).
DESCRIPTION_CODENAME_THEME_HELPER=The codename for the theme (this is used as a directory name). If you would like to make this the new <em>site</em>-default theme, enter &ldquo;{1}&rdquo; here.
PREVIEW_THEME=View site using theme
THEME__OPTION_OVERRIDES=Configuration option overrides
DESCRIPTION__THEME__OPTION_OVERRIDES=These theme settings override configuration options for this theme only.

EDIT_TEMPLATES=Edit templates
_EDIT_TEMPLATES=Edit templates for <kbd>{1}</kbd> theme
EDIT_TEMPLATE=Edit a template
DOC_TEMPLATES=Templates are almost all written in HTML5, so a good knowledge of HTML is required for editing them.\n\nAdditionally, the software's Tempcode language is used as the templating framework and for implementing special rules and data binding.
DOC_CSS=Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) control most visual aspects of your website.\n\nReferences like "[tt]{$GET,area_text}[/tt]" are used by the Theme Wizard to create pleasing colour combinations -- they are associated with equation lines like [tt]{$THEMEWIZARD_COLOR,#325180,area_text,76% seed + 24% WB}[/tt]. If you like you can either edit the colour in the line (you can ignore the equation), or you can replace the reference with a colour directly.\n\n[tt]{$IMG;,example}[/tt] refers to a theme image. You can edit these through the Admin Zone, the easiest way is to just search the Admin Zone for [tt]example[/tt].\n\nIf you want to make an accessible website for those with visual impairments, make sure that you use sufficient contrast between colours.
DOC_TEMPLATES_JAVASCRIPT=JavaScript files add interactive functionality to web pages.\n\nAdditionally, the software's Tempcode language is used for implementing special rules and data binding.
DOC_TEMPLATES_XML=XML file templates are used for just a few special things. You are unlikely to need to edit them.
DOC_TEMPLATES_TEXT=Text file templates are either written in Comcode or are just plain text. Commonly Comcode text file templates are used for templating e-mails the software sends out.
DOC_TEMPLATES_RELATED=Find which templates have been seen to co-occur to any particular template.
DOC_TEMPLATE_EDITOR_SCREENS=Meta-trees allow you to easily see the templates used to generate a screen (a web page), then edit them.\n\nIf the &ldquo;Grow template meta-tree&rdquo; option is enabled then screen meta-trees are recorded to the database as the website is browsed. Additionally, the meta-trees are logged when using some of the &ldquo;Page rendering tools&rdquo; or when the &ldquo;keep_grow_template_meta_tree=1&rdquo; parameter is in the URL.
DOC_TEMPLATE_EDITOR_COMCODE_PAGES=This is a zone, and expanding it will show Comcode pages within this zone. Comcode pages are content rather than templates. They may be edited within the template editor for convenience, as they will typically involve custom HTML and references to your CSS and JavaScript.
DOC_TEMPLATES_BY_ADDON=Template files organised by addon.
TEMPLATES_HTML=HTML
TEMPLATES_CSS=CSS

THEME_IMAGES=Theme images
DESCRIPTION_DELETE_THEME_IMAGE=Delete this theme image. This theme image is either a non-default image, or an image that has been given a new picture via uploading. Deleting the image will delete the referenced uploaded file (as long as it is not used elsewhere), and delete the theme images' entry in the image map (for all themes and languages that use it). If the theme image is still referenced somewhere, the software will try and recreate it via URL-autodetection, as is done initially for all default theme images.
DELETE_THEME_IMAGE=Delete a theme image
CHOOSE_THEME_IMAGE=Choose theme image
ADD_THEME_IMAGE=Add a theme image
DESCRIPTION_ADDING_THEME_IMAGE=<p>You are adding a new theme image, i.e. a new image under a new codename.</p><p>This will have no effect until the image is referenced somewhere, either by:</p><ul><li>using it as a menu icon (image codenames starting <kbd>icons/</kbd>)</li><li>referencing it in Tempcode using the <kbd>{$IMG}</kbd> symbol (perhaps in a template or the CSS)</li></ul><p>If there already is a theme image similar to the one you are adding you could consider re-using that one instead. Many are supplied with the default theme.</p>
EDIT_THEME_IMAGE=Edit a theme image
EDIT_THEME_IMAGES=Edit theme images
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGE_NAME=A codename for the theme image. This looks like a short-hand file-path, and new (unrecognised) image codenames are actually auto-found based on searching file-paths (out of <kbd>themes/&lt;theme&gt;/images_custom</kbd> or <kbd>themes/&lt;theme&gt;/images</kbd>, in the active theme and then the default theme). Once in the system, however, there is no requirement that an image codename actually be a real file-path.
ADDING_THEME_IMAGE=You may also add a new theme image. You will only need to do this if you are creating new modules, or adding new images for your theme that have no built-in direct equivalent in the default theme.<br /><br /><strong>If you have already placed your image into your theme <kbd>images_custom</kbd> directory</strong> then it will add automatically when it is first referenced (with a code based on its filename).
THEME_IMAGE_CURRENTLY_LIKE=Your theme image currently looks as shown in this box. It has dimensions of <strong>{1}</strong>x<strong>{2}</strong>.
THEME_IMAGE_CURRENTLY_UNMODIFIED=This image file is currently inherited from the default theme. If you edit it, it will be overridden, so that your theme has its own version of the image.
RIGHT_CLICK_SAVE_AS=If you want to edit this image, right click on it and ask your web browser to save it, then blank out the URL field and attach your new copy to the Upload field.
USE_ALL_THEMES=Use for all themes
USE_ALL_LANGS=Use for all languages
DESCRIPTION_USE_ALL_THEMES=Make it so that all themes use this image URL for this image.
DESCRIPTION_USE_ALL_LANGS=Make it so that all languages use this image URL for this image.

TEMPCODE_TESTER=Tempcode tester
RAW_PREVIEW=Raw preview

TEMPCODE_VALUE=Value

CSS_EQUATION_HELPER=CSS equation helper
DESCRIP_CSS_EQUATION_HELPER=Enter a theme wizard equation to get a CSS colour value that you can use in your CSS.

_SCREEN_PREVIEWS=Template previews
SCREEN_PREVIEW=Screen/Template Preview: {1}
HTML_PAGES=HTML Pages
ADMIN_SCREENS=Administrative screens (you probably don't need to theme these)

LOGOWIZARD=Logo Wizard
_LOGOWIZARD=Logo Wizard: Step {1} of {2}
LOGOWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=The Logo Wizard will help you quickly create a logo for your website, and apply it to the theme currently used on the main website. The logos generated are very simple, so more professional sites will only wish to use the generated logo as a placeholder.<br /><br />The whole appearance is fully customisable using the theme management features &ndash; the website logo is the <a href="{1}"><kbd>logo/-logo</kbd></a> theme image, and the standalone logo (used by e-mails, etc) is the <a href="{2}"><kbd>logo/standalone_logo</kbd></a> theme image.
THEME_NOT_SUPPORTING_LOGOWIZARD=The {1} theme does not support the Logo Wizard.
LOGOWIZARD_3_DESCRIBE=Your logo has now been applied to the theme <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
DESCRIPTION_LOGO_NAME=The name of your website, company or organisation (short names are best).
LOGO_THEME_IMAGE=Logo image
BACKGROUND_THEME_IMAGE=Background image
LOGO=Logo
DESCRIPTION_LOGOWIZARD_THEME=The theme to create the logo in. Note that the logo will also be created in the default theme, as that is usually used in the Admin and CMS zones. If you are running multiple languages, the logo will be created for the language you are personally using now.

THEMEWIZARD=Theme Wizard
_THEMEWIZARD=Theme Wizard: Step {1} of {2}
THEMEWIZARD_1_DESCRIBE=This is step 1 of the Theme Wizard. The Theme Wizard will help you quickly create a theme around a colour of your choosing, which you will be able to fully edit later.
EQUATIONS_NOT_SUPPORTED=Equations are not supported by this theme. HSV-shift will be used instead.
THEME_NOT_SUPPORTING_THEMEWIZARD=The {1} theme does not support the Theme Wizard.
THEMEWIZARD_4_DESCRIBE=You saved <kbd>{1}</kbd> as &lsquo;{2}&rsquo;.
SEED_COLOUR=Seed colour
DESCRIPTION_SEED_COLOUR=The colour around which all other colours in the theme will be built. Click within the colour spectra to adjust each of the colour components until you are satisfied with the chosen colour. Avoid choosing a colour that is very dark or bright, as lack of contrast can severely affect legibility.
INVALID_COLOUR=You entered an invalid colour. Colours must be a six-unit hexadecimal number.
THEMEWIZARD_2_DOMINANT=The dominant color in this seed is {1}.
THEMEWIZARD_2_LIGHT_DARK=This is a &ldquo;{1}&rdquo; theme.
THEMEWIZARD_2_USE=Use this theme!
INHERIT_CSS=Inherit CSS from default theme
DESCRIPTION_INHERIT_CSS=Whether to reference the default theme's CSS and apply a filter to it, rather than copy it all in. This option allows your theme CSS to upgrade between versions with greater ease, because you only specify your changes. However the big down-side is it makes the CSS harder to understand because you don't have it all in front of you.
REFRESH_TO_FINISH=It will take around 20 seconds (depending on your server) to generate your theme. Some servers have bad configuration and will terminate a script if it takes more than about 10. If this happens (you can recognise by a blank screen or an 'Internal server error') just keep clicking refresh/reload in your browser until it finishes. The Theme Wizard is smart enough to be able to pick up where it leaves off.
DESCRIPTION_SOURCE_THEME=The theme that you will be basing your new theme off. This source theme will be taken and recoloured by the wizard.
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM=Theme Wizard algorithm
DESCRIPTION_THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM=How the Theme Wizard should generate your colours.<br /><br />&ldquo;Equations&rdquo; uses Theme Wizard equations built-into the theme <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to generate the colours based purely on the seed you enter; the default theme has these equations consistently defined and the software has extra inbuilt support to make the theme images look great too. If you select this option and a theme does not support it you may not see much happen.<br /><br />&ldquo;HSV-shift&rdquo; works by comparing your source theme's existing seed colour, and the seed colour you enter, and shifting all the colours across across correspondingly. It should work on all themes, although source theme authors may need to configure their <kbd>theme.ini</kbd> file with details of any new theme images they've made that need to be re-treated (by default only a selection of the default theme images are recoloured).
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM_EQUATIONS=Equations
THEMEGEN_ALGORITHM_HSV=<abbr title="Hue/Saturation/Value">HSV</abbr>-shift
UNRESOLVABLE_COLOURS=The following colour equations could not be resolved, most likely because required colour(s) were not defined anywhere, or because mathematically, there is no solution:<br /><kbd>{1}</kbd>. <strong>Your chosen source theme probably does not support the Equations method, so try the HSV-shift method instead.</strong>
DARK_THEME=Dark theme
DESCRIPTION_DARK_THEME=Whether the theme will be a dark theme; for most websites, we would recommend keeping the theme light.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_themewizard=Theme Wizard
