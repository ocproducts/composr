DESCRIPTION_REPORT_ANONYMOUS=Report this content as a guest with no e-mail address, to conceal your identity. Caution: Doing so means the support ticket created will be made under the system identity instead of your username. Not only will this mean you will not get points for your report, but it also means you will not see the support ticket on your account nor will staff be able to follow up with you if needed.
DESCRIPTION_REPORT_EMAIL=Optionally provide an e-mail address staff can reach you at should they need to follow up with you. If you leave this blank, your anonymity is preserved, but staff cannot follow up with you if more information is needed.
DUPLICATE_REPORT=<strong>You have already reported this content, and the associated support ticket is still open.</strong> Therefore, instead of creating a new report, you will instead be adding on additional information to the support ticket that is opened.
