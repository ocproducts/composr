[strings]
DOC_TRANSLATE_CONTENT=The language content editor allows you to translate your website content to different languages. You may translate virtually anything. There is a priority system in the translate queue: the most important things are display for translation first.
DOC_TRANSLATE=The language editor allows you to translate 'strings' so that your website is displayed in a language other than the original British English. Alternatively, you may just wish to change language strings to change the 'style' of the website.\n\nThe language editor is very easy to use. All you need to do is go to the translation module, choose your language, choose the language file to translate, and then you are presented with an interface to translate the strings.\nA small level of integration is provided for languages which Google can translate, so as to provide a guide.
DOC_CRITICISE_LANGUAGE_PACK=A tool to criticise language packs is provided, to identify what has not been translated, among other things. This tool is intended for those who translate language files without using the inbuilt editor, or for those who have upgrade the software and need to update their language packs.
DOC_FIND_LANG_STRING_TIP=Language file translation is done for two different reasons:\n - to let the website (software) work in languages other than English\n - to customise text away from the default settings.\nFor the case of customisation, the "Language used on this page" feature ("Translate/re-phrase the software" in the developer tool dropdown in the footer) is perhaps the most appropriate way to make adjustments, as it will lead directly to the strings to be changed.
MULTILANG_OFF=You have not enabled multi-language mode, so you cannot translate your content into another language.
MULTILANG_OFF_CONTENT=You have not enabled multi-language content translation, so you cannot translate your content into another language.
TRANSLATE_CONTENT=Translate website content
TRANSLATE_CODE=Translate/re-phrase the software

__TRANSLATE_CODE=Translate/re-phrase the software into {1}
_TRANSLATE_CODE=Translate/re-phrase the software: '{1}' language file [{2}]
LANGUAGE_FILE=Language file
DESCRIPTION_LANGUAGE_FILE=The language file you wish to edit. Language files usually correspond with the names of blocks and modules; i.e. the language files are separated according to where their strings are used on the site.
AUTO_TRANSLATE=Translate automatically
DESCRIPTION_NEW_LANG=Or create a new language (should be like an <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> language code, maximum 5 characters).
INVALID_LANG_CODE=The language code should be like an <abbr title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</abbr> language code, with a maximum 5 characters.
CRITICISE_LANGUAGE_PACK=Criticise language pack
CRITICISM_MISSING_FILE=This file has not been translated: <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
CRITICISM_MISSING_STRING=This string has not been translated: <kbd>{1}</kbd> (British English is &lsquo;{2}&rsquo;).
CRITICISM_EXTRA_STRING=This string should not exist here: <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
CRITICISM_PARAMETER_COUNT_MISMATCH=The number of parameters in this string is incorrect: <kbd>{1}</kbd> (British English is &lsquo;{2}&rsquo;).
LANGUAGE_FINE=The language pack is perfect. This is an impressive achievement.
CHOOSE_EDIT_LIST_LANG_FILE=Choose a language file to edit from the list (and the language pack to take the file from).<br /><br />The <a target="_blank" title="Change installation options (this will open in a new window)" href="{3}">website's default language</a> is currently set to <kbd>{1}</kbd> ({2}). You are currently viewing in <kbd>{4}</kbd> ({5}). The language used specifies the Comcode page versions, the language strings, the content translations, and the theme image versions.
CHOOSE_CRITICISE_LIST_LANG_FILE=Choose a language file to scan from the list (and the language pack to take the file from).
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_lang=Language
BLOCK_TRANS_NAME_side_language=Language-choice form
TRANSLATE_TOO_MANY=There is more that can be translated (<strong>{1}</strong> {1|record|records}). We only looked up the highest priority <em>{2}</em> records that have not yet been translated or have outmoded (broken) translations.
NOTHING_TO_TRANSLATE=There is nothing that needs translating.
TRANSLATE_CONTENT_SCREEN=<p class="lonely_label">Use this screen to translate content:</p><ul><li>Things that have not yet been translated at all (and not edited in {1} either) are given empty boxes for you to type translations in.</li><li>Things that need re-translating (because the original text has since been edited) are pre-populated with the existing outmoded translation.</li></ul><p>To re-translate content use the &lsquo;Translate website content&rsquo; footer links from the individual screens featuring that content &ndash; this will bring up a contextual editing form.</p>
TRANSLATION_GUIDE=There is quite a lot to learn to do translation properly. Make sure you read the <a target="_blank" title="Translation tutorial (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}">translation tutorial</a> carefully. Consider using <a target="_blank" title="Transifex (this link will open in a new window)" href="{1}">Transifex</a>, so that you and other's can work together. Many people like to work from inside Composr to get direct results, often using the "Translate/re-phrase the software" in the developer tool dropdown in the footer to translate screens individually; but Transifex allows sharing and has much more powerful editing features.
CANNOT_CRITICISE_BASE_LANG=Sorry we cannot criticise the base language (English), as this is the reference point we use for comparisons.
TRANSLATION_PROGRESS={1} (<strong>{2}/{3}</strong> {3|string|strings} translated}
ADDING_CONTENT_IN_LANGUAGE=You are currently selected to be using <strong>{1}</strong>. Content you add will be saved against {1}, but available in all languages. For it to be properly translated the website staff will need to process it via the content translation queue.
ADDING_CONTENT_IN_LANGUAGE_STAFF=You are currently selected to be using <strong>{1}</strong>. Content you add will be saved against {1}, but available in all languages. We would actually advise that you <a target="_self" href="{3}">switch to {2}</a> (the default website language) to add this content, and then you perform any translations from the &ldquo;translate website content&rdquo; option in the website footer.
EDITING_CONTENT_IN_LANGUAGE_STAFF=You are currently selected to be using <strong>{1}</strong>. Content you edit will be saved against {1}, but your changes will not be applied to any pre-existing translations. Instead those translations will be marked outdated and come up for re-translation in the content translation queue which the website staff will have to process. We would actually advise that you <a target="_self" href="{3}">switch to {2}</a> to make this edit, and then you perform any translations from the &ldquo;translate website content&rdquo; option in the website footer.
POWERED_BY=Powered by {1}
