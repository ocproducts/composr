TIP_0a=Welcome to the Admin Zone, the administrative heart of your website. The first thing you should do with a new {2} installation is to run the &lsquo;Setup Wizard&rsquo; to perform basic configuration. You will find the site wizard at Admin Zone > Setup > Setup Wizard. If you are not sure which area of {2} to use to perform a task, try using the &lsquo;Search for&rsquo;; feature in the top-right. You may also refer to the <a href="{5}">{2} documentation</a> for help.\n\nDismiss this tip when you are ready to move on to the next level of tips.
TIP_1a=You can create a quick personalised theme using the &lsquo;Theme Wizard&rsquo;, located at Admin Zone > Style > Theme Wizard.
TIP_1b=Content is King: almost all good websites have good content, so get working on your own unique content as soon as possible.
TIP_1c=Presentation is key: visitors judge websites in a fraction of a second.
TIP_1d=Quality not quantity: {2} has a huge number of public-facing features for you to use, but don't feel the need to use them all, because you can't afford to overwhelm your visitors or dilute your site.
TIP_1e=Keep regular backups: even if you make no mistakes and know precisely what you're doing, there could be a fire in your remote data center, for example.
TIP_1f=If stuck, check the <a href="{5}">documentation</a> (including the <a title="Frequently Asked Questions" href="{6}faq.htm">FAQ</a>). If you're still stuck, the chat button in the footer opens up your support options on the page you're at. You should actually read the documentation anyway as you will find it an enormous help &ndash; we have provided general advice on running websites as well as {2}-specific advice.
TIP_1g=Please <a href="{1}">give feedback</a> to the developers so that we may improve things in future versions. It is enormously important to us that your {2} experience is as good as we can make it.
TIP_1h=The developers of {2} are available to do work on a commercial basis. If you need new features developed for your website and can budget for it <a target="_blank" href="{3}">consider contacting the developers</a>. (If not that's cool too, {2} is Open Source so our business model is to serve both the open community and corporate userbases)
TIP_1i=The news system is very flexible and can also be used for blogs and articles. It is actually possible for you to set a privilege (&lsquo;Have personal categories&rsquo;, under the &lsquo;Submission&rsquo; set of privileges) that allows all members of your site to have their own blog.
TIP_1j=To delete something in {2}, go to edit it: you will see options for deletion on the edit screen.
TIP_1k=Try to not add excessive text to your website: people have a short atten-
TIP_1l=You can quickly make edits to most data in {2} just by clicking on it and typing into the edit box that appears. This is one of many examples of cutting-edge &lsquo;<abbr title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML">AJAX</abbr>&rsquo; technology used within {2}.
TIP_1m=Want to discuss things with other {2} users? Visit the <a href="{4}">{2} forum</a>.
TIP_1n=You can find just about anything using the Admin Zone search. You can even type in CSS class names and it will give you a link straight through to the code.
TIP_2a=If you like to edit template files by hand using a text editor then you may do so, as long as you disable the Template cache until you finish your editing.
TIP_2b=It's important to understand the structure of your website: {2} actually goes to incredible lengths to make sure that all your data is meticulously organised so that permissions can be assigned in an easy and logical way (and of course so that your website isn't a muddle to navigate). You can see the complete structure of your website using the &lsquo;Sitemap Editor&rsquo; at Admin Zone > Structure > Sitemap Editor.
TIP_2c=If you are a Windows users, you might consider ditching Internet Explorer and use an alternative but equally free browser, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>. Not only are these browsers better at displaying pages, but by switching you help break the monopoly Microsoft have constructed with IE &ndash; for years IE has stagnated, and developers such as the {2} developers can attest to the inordinate number of development problems that occur due to Microsoft's neglect. It limits progress in a real way.
TIP_2d=Don't attach files more than a few dozen megabytes in size to forms whenever possible &ndash; instead, upload them using FTP and reference their URLs. It is a limitation of the World Wide Web that form-based uploads are unstable.
TIP_2e=The best design tool in the world is a pen and pad of paper, or if you have one, a whiteboard. Design your website layout off the computer, and then implement it bit-by-bit in {2}.
TIP_2f=A forum community can make a website come alive &ndash; it can also make a website lose its controlled, professional feel. This is just one example demonstrating why you need to give thought to which {2} features you want to use, and how to use them.
TIP_2g=Use either <a href="{6}tut-google-analytics.htm">Google Analytics</a>, or the inbuilt <a href="{6}tut-statistics.htm">statistics</a> features to see how your site is being used. With careful study, you can identify navigation problems, and where your strengths and weaknesses are (to allow you to focus your efforts).
TIP_2h=A common need is to give people access by default, but to be able to take away access on abuse. To do this, you could switch a user's usergroup to one with less privileges, but this requires maintaining of full permission sets for multiple usergroups. If you are using Conversr (the inbuilt member/forum system), a better technique is to define a new &lsquo;default usergroup&rsquo; that only has permissions for the abusable feature &ndash; new users will be put into that usergroup as well as the main usergroup which has wider permissions. To remove a user after their abuse, just remove them from the new &lsquo;default usergroup&rsquo;.
TIP_2i={2} can cater for websites large and small &ndash; as your site grows, stop trying to set permissions by editing things, and start using the &lsquo;Permission tree editor&rsquo; &ndash; it'll save you a lot of time when making batch changes as well as allowing you to see a complete view of your permissions!
TIP_2j=People will always abuse you and your website regardless of how good it is. Large websites will always get negative feedback from users who are super-liberal (thinking they have a right to free action on your website without following any rules) and users who are super-conservative (thinking that everyone should act in the certain way that represents their personal viewpoint). As a webmaster, you need a thick skin &ndash; try and be fair and balanced, and don't take criticism too harshly, especially when it conflicts.
TIP_2k=Use transparent redirection pages to allow zones to share panels.
TIP_2l=If you want the forum to be the heart of your website, add a transparent redirection so that the Welcome zone &lsquo;start&rsquo; page points to the Forum zone &lsquo;forumview&rsquo; page.
TIP_2m=Make good use of your browser developer tools. Browsers now contain great tools for interactively working with CSS that you can use in supplement to {2}'s own CSS editing capability (to test out ideas interactively before saving them in {2}).
TIP_2n=Consider using permission-restricted forums for discussion between staff even if you have real-world meetings. You will find them a very convenient for having quick thoughtful discussions where no participator feels pressed to &lsquo;answer on the spot&rsquo;. There is also less need to co-schedule or take minutes.
TIP_2o=The point system is a great community invigoration tool &ndash; by creating an economy, you add a new facet to your community that raises interest level and a competitive factor.
TIP_2p=Regularly change add content to your website, or randomise content display using the <kbd>main_content</kbd> block. This will keep your visitors returning, which in turn will make them more likely to recommend your website to others.
TIP_2q=You will find the &lsquo;Show template edit links&rsquo; and &lsquo;Template tree&rsquo; and &lsquo;Language&rsquo; options in the list of options in the footer very useful for changing the templates and language strings of the page you are viewing.
TIP_2r=Turn on the software error e-mails if they're not already. We regularly fix minor bugs that people wouldn't bother report based on these, making the product more stable for everyone. You can do this by going to Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Site
TIP_2s=Use the Comcode <var>hide</var> tag to place messages that are obscured until consciously uncovered. This is great for placing warnings (such as <kbd>spoilers</kbd> or disclaimers) or hiding answers to questions so to give the reader time to think.
TIP_3a=If you have untrustworthy people around you, switch to conceded mode after using the Admin or CMS zones&hellip; that way, anyone using your computer will need need your password to cause any mischief.
TIP_3b=Use the &lsquo;SU&rsquo; feature to test your site as any user of your choosing. It's easy (regrettably, but inevitably) to make mistakes when setting permissions and lock off an important portion of your site to those that should be able to see it. You can activate &lsquo;SU&rsquo; manually by appending <kbd>&amp;keep_su=&lt;username&gt;</kbd> to the URL. &lsquo;SU&rsquo; is superior to logging in as another member not just due to speed, but also because you will still be able to see things such as stack traces.
TIP_3c=When designing {2} sites, you need to consider the modularity of the system. Modularity is fantastic because it allows {2} to serve so many different kinds of website with just a shuffling around of the features: but it also inevitably requires a different way of thinking. You need to think about how to achieve things using the features {2} provides, rather than trying to force {2} to conform to rigid preconceptions. The end result is often a better website than what was originally planned, because of the extras {2} offers.
TIP_3d=When themeing, you need to think in terms of editing and rearranging individual sections of the site as well as global sweeping things such as &lsquo;standard boxes&rsquo; &ndash; in other words, you need to think in terms of the design framework that {2} defines, rather than just in terms of an end design. With experience, you won't feel limited by {2}, but assisted &ndash; you'll be able to make use of the framework to carry your style.
TIP_3e=While the &lsquo;Theme Wizard&rsquo; can automatically create a theme for you, it won't create unique designs variations. You can, however, radically change the layout of your website by changing three things: CSS, templates and theme images. All the tools to allow you to do this are in {2} &ndash; you will need a basic understanding of the technologies involved, but once learnt, you'll be able to make your website unrecognisable to any other {2} website. Alternatively you could download a pre-made theme as an addon, or pay someone to make one.
TIP_3f=Creating {2} and maintaining it as free is enormously difficult for the developers even if paying only average salaries: if you love the product, please help us make it better by helping us gain new customers. If every user refers one more unique support customer, everyone would be using {2} and we'd have more money to reinvest. We help you grow your community &ndash; help us grow ours.
TIP_3g=Please refer {2} to others and help grow the community.
TIP_3h=You can quickly add large numbers of downloads by uploading them to a directory using FTP, then using filesystem download importer to add them all to the download system in one sweep.
TIP_3i=Press the menu button towards the bottom-left of the screen to bring up the management menu wherever you are on your website. This really speeds up administration.
TIP_3j=Press Alt+O to bring up the Commandr command line wherever you are on your website. Experts use Commandr to interactively work with the guts of {2}, so that they don't have to program new features into it every time they want to do something unusual.
TIP_3k=You may place other websites' syndicated news on your site by using the RSS blocks. These blocks support both Atom and RSS feeds.
TIP_3l=Use Custom Comcode to quickly build Comcode pages that follow a common pattern.
TIP_3m=The calendar is useful for much more than just group scheduling &ndash; the reminder system is particularly useful and allows it to be used as a secure substitute for a diary (as the Internet becomes available just about anywhere, the advantage to storing information on the Internet becomes more significant).
TIP_3n=Use the Comcode <var>page</var> tag instead of the <var>url</var> tag whenever referring to local URLs. By doing this you can gain protection against changes in URL behaviour between versions and the effect on URLs by pages moved between zones.
TIP_3o=<a href="{6}tut-intl.htm">The language editor</a> is not just useful for translating the original {2} British English to another language &ndash; it is also useful for stylistic customisation of language.
TIP_3p=If you need to place some Comcode within Comcode, written in literal form (i.e. not parsed), either place it within a Comcode <var>code</var> tag, or put <kbd>\</kbd> symbols before the <kbd>[</kbd> symbols.
TIP_3q=Don't ever edit {2} files if avoidable. Instead, make proper use of the {2} <kbd>_custom</kbd> override system: for example if you edit the file <kbd>sources/global2.php</kbd>, save your edit as <kbd>sources_custom/global2.php</kbd>. This will allow you to perform upgrades more easily. The same applies to theme images: use {2}'s theme image forms to update images, rather than overriding the source files in the default theme.
TIP_4a=If you have the associated notification enabled, {2} will send out notifications whenever it parses Comcode with broken links in it: this will help you make sure your website stays stable. If you clear your Comcode cache, then {2} will have to reparse all Comcode, and hence will pick up any newly broken links.
TIP_4b=The calendar can be used as a scheduling system for system commands. If you're a real {2} Pro, you'll be able to write scripts in Commandr to execute at regular intervals of your choosing.
TIP_4c=When editing templates, use Tempcode if you need to perform simple or even advanced calculations; for example, the <kbd>IF_NON_EMPTY</kbd> Tempcode directive is very useful when wrapping extra HTML around a template parameter that may sometimes be blank (we use <kbd>IF_NON_EMPTY</kbd> to only apply the extra HTML in the case where it is surrounding something actually there).
TIP_4d=If you are running a site where security is a high priority and if you are using Conversr, consider enabling IP address-based security for your primary usergroup. This way, even if someone manages to steal your password, they can't access your account from a computer other than yours, unless they have access to your e-mail.
TIP_4e=If you are struggling to find what permissions to set, and don't mind dealing with some technical tools and language, you can use FirePHP with {2}. You need to install FirePHP into your browser (or a compatible system such as FirePHP4Chrome). You then need to temporarily append <kbd>&amp;keep_firephp=1</kbd> to your website URL in your browser. If things have gone right, a full list of permissions, templates, and queries, used to generate the screen you're viewing will be shown within FirePHP.
TIP_4f=RSS/Atom if a fantastic way to keep on-top of activity on your website. If you'd like to use RSS/Atom feeds but need them to feature privileged content (i.e. more than just guest content), add <kbd>&amp;auth=1</kbd> to the URL in your feed reader. This will cause the reader to prompt you for login details, and will result in an privileged feed.
ALL_TIPS_READ=You have permanently dismissed all the tips in the system. Best wishes with your website, the {2} developers. All tips can also be found in the <a href="{7}">Dos and Do-nots of a ({2}) website</a> tutorial.
