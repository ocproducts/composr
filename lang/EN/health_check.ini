HEALTH_CHECK=Health Check

MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_health_check=Health Check

CONFIG_CATEGORY_HEALTH_CHECK=Health Check options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__HEALTH_CHECK=Options related to the Health Check system. Many of these options are configurable activation thresholds for what qualifies as a problem.

PERFORMANCE=Performance
AUTOMATIC_CHECKS=Automatic checks
CONFIG_GROUP_DEFAULT_DESCRIP_FLOOD_CONTROL=These options will only work if rate-limiting is enabled and configured. These options don't define additional rate-limits, they just define when to flag up high rates as a health problem to be investigated.

HC_IS_TEST_SITE=Test site
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_is_test_site=Whether this is a test site. Test sites have different (mainly fewer) tests run than a live site.

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_is_test_site_VALUE_1=Yes
HC_SCAN_PAGE_LINKS=Targets to scan
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_scan_page_links=A list of page-links or URLs to scan for various problems on. List your most important or most failure-prone pages. &ldquo;<kbd>:</kbd>&rdquo; is the home page.

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_disk_space_threshold=The minimum amount of free disk space in Megabytes.

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cron_threshold=The maximum reasonable time in seconds for the system scheduler to take to run.
HC_CPU_PCT_THRESHOLD=Maximum CPU load
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cpu_pct_threshold=The maximum CPU load (as a percentage).
HC_CPU_NORMATIVE_THRESHOLD=Minimum CPU performance
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cpu_normative_threshold=This is a measure of &ldquo;normative performance&rdquo;, where 100 was the score produced by a late-2014 iMac. Most hosting-industry-supplied servers do not perform that well as they are either made with low-cost hardware, recycled old hardware, or are actually virtual machines.
HC_IO_PCT_THRESHOLD=Maximum I/O load
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_io_pct_threshold=The maximum I/O load (as a percentage).
HC_PAGE_SPEED_THRESHOLD=Maximum page load time
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_page_speed_threshold=The maximum time in seconds after which a page request is considered slow. The default threshold is quite high because we may have stale caches or load spiking; we're looking for major issues, not testing our overall optimisation.
HC_PROCESS_HANG_THRESHOLD=Maximum process run-time
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_process_hang_threshold=The maximum time in minutes after which one of the monitored processes is considered to have hung.
HC_PROCESSES_TO_MONITOR=Processes to monitor
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_processes_to_monitor=A <a title="Regular Expressions (this link will open in a new window)" target="_blank" href="http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php">regular expression</a> showing which process names to hold to a maximum run-time.
HC_RAM_THRESHOLD=Minimum free RAM
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_ram_threshold=The minimum amount of free RAM in Megabytes.
HC_TRANSFER_LATENCY_THRESHOLD=Maximum transfer latency
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_transfer_latency_threshold=The maximum download latency in seconds (measured as time downloading Google home page).
HC_TRANSFER_SPEED_THRESHOLD=Minimum transfer speed
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_transfer_speed_threshold=The minimum transfer speed in Megabits per second (not Megabytes). This is upload speed from the server perspective and download speed from the visitor perspective.
HC_UPTIME_THRESHOLD=Maximum uptime value
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_uptime_threshold=The maximum value of the system 'uptime'.
HC_IO_MBS=Minimum IO read-speed
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_io_mbs=The minimum number of MB/s that can be read per second off the disk.

HC_DATABASE_THRESHOLD=Maximum database size
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_database_threshold=The maximum database size in Megabytes. If you have a database size limit, set this to around 80% of the limit to leave room for growth and for non-cleaned deleted rows.

HC_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND_THRESHOLD=Maximum requests per second for a visitor
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_requests_per_second_threshold=The maximum requests per second for a visitor before it is considered a problem. The problem being a likely <abbr title="Denial Of Service">DOS</abbr> attack.
HC_REQUESTS_WINDOW_SIZE=Request window size for a visitor
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_requests_window_size=The number of requests within the rate-count window to calculate a &ldquo;Requests per second for a visitor&rdquo; value with. If there are fewer recent requests from the visitor than this then no calculation will be performed and no check done.
HC_COMPOUND_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND_THRESHOLD=Maximum requests per second in total
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_compound_requests_per_second_threshold=The maximum requests per second for all visitors together before it is considered a problem. The problem being a likely <abbr title="Denial Of Service">DDOS</abbr> attack, or just an indication we need more system resources.
HC_COMPOUND_REQUESTS_WINDOW_SIZE=Request window size in total
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_compound_requests_window_size=The number of requests within the rate-count window to calculate a &ldquo;Requests per second in total&rdquo; value with. If there are fewer recent requests across all visitors than this then no calculation will be performed and no check done.

HC_CRON_SECTIONS_TO_RUN=Check sections to run

CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cron_regularity=The number of minutes between automatic health checks.
HC_CRON_NOTIFY_REGARDLESS=Send full reports
CONFIG_OPTION_hc_cron_notify_regardless=Send notification reports of automatic health checks even if everything passes. This is useful if you worry the site may break badly and you would not notice, as the health check system itself would have gone down. You would calendar yourself to regularly check that you receive these notifications.

NOTIFICATION_TYPE_health_check=Health Check results
HEALTH_CHECK_SUBJECT_fail=Health Check failed
