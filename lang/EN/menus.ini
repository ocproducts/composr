[descriptions]
SITE_META=This means "Relating to the website", and is used for a menu header in the default menus

[strings]
MISSING_CAPTION_ERROR=All captions must be filled-in
MISSING_URL_ERROR=All URL fields for childless branches must be filled-in
ABOUT_DELETE_MENU=There is rarely a reason to delete a menu, but if you do wish to, click the &lsquo;Delete&rsquo; button. Please note that if you have blocks referencing this menu and you delete it, those blocks will indicate that there is a &lsquo;missing menu&rsquo;.
ADD_BRANCH=Add branch (e.g. another link)
BRANCH=Branch
BRANCH_TYPE=Branch type
CONTRACTED_BRANCH=Contracted branch
EXPANDED_BRANCH=Expanded branch
LINK=Link
ENTRY_POINTS_DESCRIPTION=&lsquo;Entry points&rsquo; are a special kind of &lsquo;page-link&rsquo; that you may jump into without any special further parameters. For example, the <kbd>downloads</kbd> module (if installed) lets you jump into the root category, and Comcode pages allow you to jump in arbitrarily as they take no parameters. You can choose from the entry points available within the website below (once you have selected a menu branch).
BRANCHES_DESCRIPTION=Menus consist of &lsquo;branches&rsquo;. Branches may hold child branches, or may just be links. Whether branches with children may have links of their own, or are allowed, depends on the type of menu.<br />Note that this menu editor does not define the style a menu is displayed in or its box title &ndash; this is defined separately, according to what parameters are used with the <kbd>menu</kbd> block (usually edited in the Zone Editor).</p><p>Note that menu structure (what's on what menus) is entirely separate from site structure (zones) and category/Comcode page structure. To control site structure, use the <a href="{1}">Sitemap Editor</a>. Category/Comcode page structure is controlled from the add/edit screens of individual categories/Comcode pages.
CAPTION_LONG=Tooltip
MENU_ENTRY_CAPTION_LONG=The tooltip for the branch (may be blank).
MENU_ENTRY_MATCH_KEYS=A comma-separated list of match-keys that list which screens this menu link will show on, or leave blank for the menu link to always show. For example, <kbd>_WILD:_WILD:add</kbd> then the link will only show on &lsquo;ad&rsquo; screens. If you want to prevent guests seeing this link, you can do a little trick of entering some Tempcode in here that limits their viewing of this link to an unmatchable match-key, e.g. <kbd>{$?,{$IS_GUEST},_never_}</kbd>.
MENU_ENTRY_URL=An URL, or a page-link/entry-point (which you can pick to the right).
MENU_ENTRY_BRANCH=May just link to a page, or be initially expanded/contracted with children. Will be ignored for <abbr title="These menu types: zone, embossed, select, top">flat menu types</abbr>.
MENU_ENTRY_NEW_WINDOW=Open link into new window
MENU_ENTRY_CHECK_PERMS=Only display if has permission
DESCRIPTION_MENU_ENTRY_CHECK_PERMS=Only display the link for a viewer if there are sufficient permissions for that viewer to access the page. This option will only work with page-links, not URLs.

INCLUDE_SITEMAP_NO=(Do not include)

CLICK_ENTRY_POINT_TO_USE_2=Clicking an entry point will use it for your link.
MENU_UNDERSCORE_RESERVED=Custom menus may not start with an underscore (&ldquo;_&rdquo;) character, as menu names starting with this character are reserved to represent hard-coded menus.
DESCRIPTION_THEME_IMAGE_FOR_MENU_ITEM=The theme image (if you choose to have one) that is shown next to the menu item. The selection list includes all <kbd>icons/*</kbd> theme images in the default theme. Please note that some of the default menu-type templates can't display theme images.
CONFIRM_DELETE_LINK=Are you sure that you want to delete the link to &ldquo;{1}&rdquo;?
CONFIRM_DELETE_LINK_NICE=What would you like to do to the "{1}" branch?
MOVETO_MENU=Move to another menu
MOVE_MENU_ITEM=Move menu branch
CONFIRM_MOVE_LINK_NICE=Where would you like to move the "{1}" branch?
COPY_TO_EDITABLE_MENU=You are currently using automatically-generated menus. Would you like to copy the current automated menus into an editable menu, and switch to that editable menu? If you do this you will then have full control, but will be responsible for adding/removing links when you add/remove pages.

DOC_WRITING=Pages can be edited with the [abbr="What You See Is What You Get"]WYSIWYG[/abbr] editor, but you can add in extra things such as blocks or text effects, using Comcode (that's what the square brackets are for).\n\n[surround][title="3"]A note on accessibility[/title]\n\nWhen writing for any kind of publication, it is important to use clear language which is appropriate for the audience you are targeting. Using good grammar and spelling not only makes your text correct, but most importantly, it makes it easier to read and understand - a small conscious effort will lead to a significant improvement for all your readers.\n\nFor your text to be accessible to those with certain kinds of disability, you should make sure:\n - colour is not used alone to convey information\n - text is well-spaced into logical paragraphs\n - if you are writing a long piece of text, consider using headings and an index (the software can maintain the index for you if you use the 'contents' Comcode tag)\n - Specify the expansion of each abbreviation or acronym in a document where it first occurs\n - Place distinguishing information at the beginning of headings, paragraphs, and lists, so that your text may be quickly understood on its first read\n - use clear, precise, and understandable language: avoid complex words unless there is a good reason for them[/surround]
DOC_MENUS='menus' usually reside on panel-pages [no_parse]('panels')[/no_parse] which are placed around the main section of the website. They consist of links which may be organised in a tree structure, and displayed in various ways (for example, as pop-up menus, or expansion menus).
DOC_PHPINFO='PHP info' displays information about the PHP server environment. This is based on a feature PHP itself provides, of the same name -- but we also add in some extra checks of our own, putting out warnings if software requirements are not met.\n\nInformation includes all the technical details of the PHP configuration, such as the installed PHP extensions and the defined options.\n\nSome PHP options can be defined in the '.htaccess' file (Apache non-CGI web server users only), as illustrated by the default [tt]recommended.htaccess[/tt] file. On CGI servers you need to use a custom [tt]php.ini[/tt] file instead (see our FAQ). Full details of this are in the [url="PHP manual"]http://uk.php.net//docs.php[/url].\n\nThe PHP info is also convenient for identifying wider factors of the system environment, such as server paths.
PHPINFO=PHP-Info / Server Checks
NO_SERVER_ISSUES_FOUND=No server compatibility issues were detected.
CONTACT=Contact
PARTNER_SITES=Partner sites
DOC_NETLINK=The linking of different installations, linked via a forum, into a 'multi-site-network' (an M.S.N.) is supported by this software. This is an important feature for networks of websites which share a common community, but are segmented, for reasons such as:\n - Division of staff, either on a hierarchical basis or a basis of co-operation by a loose-knit alliance of websites\n - Strong division of content, perhaps for sub-branding or clarity\n - A balance between autonomy and co-operation between websites that wish to share a visitor-base
DOC_NETLINK_1=Configure a list of partner websites. This is one of the software's 'multi-site-network' (M.S.N.) features.

DOC_HELPER_PANEL=Put your mouse over an icon to view a description of it.
DOC_ADMIN_ZONE=As a webmaster, it is important that you are able to monitor and control every facet of your website. This is possible through the Admin Zone: the heart of your website.
DOC_DASHBOARD=The dashboard shows an overview of your website status, activity, outstanding tasks, and links to useful external resources.
DOC_STRUCTURE=Structure is very important to your website: without a solid structure, your website would just be a jumble of information and features. Structure provides navigation and organisation.\n\nThe software has a core system as well as addons: some of what you would consider essential to your website may be provided by addons (because what you might consider essential for your website might be considered unnecessary clutter for others). Official addons can be installed or uninstalled at any time, and (depending on experience) you can also install or make other addons as desired (the system is highly extendable).
DOC_AUDIT=The audit section of the Admin Zone contains all the logs for various aspects of your website, as well as visual representations of activity, and tracking features.
DOC_STYLE=Presentation is key - without it, your website content and functionality are likely not to even be discovered. This section of the Admin Zone is where you can change the appearance of your website. The software has exceptional themeing support, with a whole range of features from simple personalisation by filling in a few form fields, to advanced programming features to completely restructure the layout of your website.\n\n[b]You can find additional contextual style tools in the footer, where it says &lsquo;(Select page rendering tool)&rsquo;.[/b]
DOC_SETUP=In this section of the Admin Zone you will find tools to setup your website. This may be the area you spend most time in initially, but visit less and less over time. If this is your first visit, we recommend you use the 'Setup Wizard' to quickly set the most important options in a user-friendly way.
DOC_TOOLS=These are tools to accomplish specific website tasks. Most tools here are advanced and you need not have any understanding of them: as your website grows, you may however find them very useful.
DOC_SECURITY=This section allows you to modify all settings related to security (including staff, usergroups and censorship).\n\nThere is a vast array of settings here, particularly the 'Permissions tree editor', which you will find very useful for identifying and setting permissions across your whole website.\n\nThe developers take all security considerations very seriously, so many internal security mechanisms are provided that you shouldn't need to manually configure. Thus, they are not presented in this section.
DOC_CMS=The Content Management Zone is the place to manage most of the categories and entries on the system.\n\nA rough definition of what is considered content is anything you might expect to be readily added on-the-fly. Some forms of content are designed to be added from the main website (for example, comments and forum posts), so are not presented here.
DOC_FRONTEND_ICONS=These are frontend icons belonging to a particular page grouping. Usually these would not be viewed via the Admin Zone, but this screen exists in order to give the page grouping's Sitemap node a page-link.

BLOCK_menu_PARAM_silent_failure=Whether no error message is to be output, if the menu does not exist. Default: '0'.
