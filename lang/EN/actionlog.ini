VIEW_ACTIONLOGS=Action logs (audit trail)
DOC_ACTIONLOG=The action log will allow you to trace what actions have been performed on the site; and where given, the reasons for doing them. This log gives a combined view of submission, administration, and moderation actions, and provides integration with the tracing and IP banning modules, as well as submitter banning of its own.
DOC_ACTIONLOG_BAN_HELP=This screen to find information relating to a website user. It's purpose is as a hub for information, and does not provide any information that is not also available elsewhere in the software. The primary screen for managing a joined member is the member's profile screen.\n\nThe software has tried to pull together as much as it can, by trying to match against the triad of [b]IP address[/b], [b]member ID[/b], and [b]username[/b]/[b]author[/b]. Links are provided that correspond to each of these, each link providing a different perspective on what is likely a single user.\n\nIf you would like to ban the member, it is advised that this be done through their member profile. If you would like to provide a more low-level ban against IP address, note down their IP address groups and then proceed to the [url="IP ban"]{1}[/url] screen. Before proceeding though, it is advisable to carefully research the usages of each IP address set by performing additional IP-based lookups (following the IP addresses as linked will lead you to the appropriate screens).

DOC_REVISIONS=View old content text that has been lost through edits or deletes.

The functionality is useful for restoring accidental loses, or investigating malicious activity that might have been covered up.
ABOUT_REVISIONS=This screen shows all the edits and deletes matching the search filter. From here old content versions can be reviewed and historic records may be deleted.<br /><br />The action log has a wider set of actions and will link through to revisions for some of those actions also &ndash; revisions are a more specific concept. Edits to Comcode pages will not show here as these revisions are stored on disk rather than in the database &ndash; but those can be found when editing a particular page or via the action log.
