[strings]
REDIRECTS=Redirects
DOC_REDIRECTS=You can set up 2 kinds of redirect: Page Redirects, and URL Redirects. Page Redirects redirect between software pages, while URL Redirects are lower-level and can redirect between any URLs.
MODULE_TRANS_NAME_admin_redirects=Redirects

NEW_REDIRECT=New redirect
EXISTING_REDIRECTS=Existing redirects

DOC_PAGE_REDIRECTS=Page Redirects allow you to automatically redirect users from one software zone+page URL to another.\n\nOptionally, this redirection may be 'transparent' such that the user doesn't know a redirection is in place, and thus sees the page as if it was in the zone they accessed it from. For security reasons the user still needs permission to view the page as it would be in its original location.

SET_PAGE_REDIRECTS=Set Page Redirects
REDIRECT_FROM_PAGE=From page
REDIRECT_FROM_ZONE=From zone

NOTES_ABOUT_PAGE_REDIRECTS=Store any notes you may have about your Page Redirects here.

DOC_URL_REDIRECTS=URL Redirects allow you to redirect between any arbitrary URLs of your choosing. These redirects are typically useful for creating short marketing-friendly URLs, or redirecting old URLs to new ones.
URL_REDIRECTS=URL redirects
SET_URL_REDIRECTS=Set URL Redirects
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_MISSING_HTACCESS=An Apache <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file is missing and the URL Redirects feature needs it. We provide a default file you can copy, <kbd>recommended.htaccess</kbd>.
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_CORRUPT_HTACCESS=The <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> does not contain the default code needed for the URL Redirects feature to work.
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_UNWRITABLE_HTACCESS=The Apache <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> file is not writable by the web server. Appropriate permissions need to be set.
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_NOT_APACHE=You probably cannot use URL Redirects because you do not seem to be running the Apache webserver. We will allow you to save redirects but unless your server supports them, it won't work.
URL_REDIRECT_full=Full match: From must be a complete match for a URL
URL_REDIRECT_prefix=Prefix: From is a prefix to a URL, remaining portion of the matched URL will be discarded
URL_REDIRECT_prefix_with_append=Prefix with transfer: From is a prefix to a URL, remaining portion of the matched URL will be appended to To
URL_REDIRECT_ERROR_BAD_BASE_URL=The From URL must start with <kbd>{1}</kbd>.
