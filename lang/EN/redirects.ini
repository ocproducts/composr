[strings]
DOC_REDIRECTS=Redirects may be configured to allow pages to be usable from one URL (technically, a zone and page name combination), where they actually reside under a different one.\n\nOptionally, this redirection may be 'transparent' such that the user doesn't know a redirection is in place, and thus sees the page as if it was in the zone they accessed it from; for security reasons, with a transparent redirection the user still needs permission to view the page as it would be in its original location.
REDIRECTS=Redirects
SET_REDIRECTS=Set redirects
TEXT_REDIRECTS=Redirects allow you to automatically redirect users from one page to another (software pages, not arbitrary URLs). Redirects have many useful purposes; for example, to redirect website visitors straight to the &ldquo;Forums&rdquo; zone, you could add a redirect on the &ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; zone <kbd>start</kbd> page, to the &ldquo;Forums&rdquo; zone <kbd>forumview</kbd> page. Other uses include making easy-to-guess URLs, duplicating modules across zones, or allowing old URLs to remain functional even though pages have moved.<br /><br />Tick (check) the &lsquo;Trs.&rsquo; (transparent redirect) column if the redirect should be invisible and not change the visitor's URL (otherwise the visitor will be informed that they have been redirected and their URL will change).
