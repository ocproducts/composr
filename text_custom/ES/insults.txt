This is the END for you, you gutter-crawling cur!=And I've got a little TIP for you, get the POINT?
Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab!=First you better stop waiving it like a feather-duster.
My handkerchief will wipe up your blood!=So you got that job as janitor, after all.
People fall at my feet when they see me coming.=Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
I once owned a dog that was smarter then you.=He must have taught you everything you know.
You make me want to puke.=You make me think somebody already did.
Nobody's ever drawn blood from me and nobody ever will.=You run THAT fast?
You fight like a dairy farmer.=How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
I got this scar on my face during a mighty struggle!=I hope now you've learned to stop picking your nose.
Have you stopped wearing diapers yet?=Why, did you want to borrow one?
I've heard you were a contemptible sneak.=Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all.
You're no match for my brains, you poor fool.=I'd be in real trouble if you ever used them.
You have the manners of a beggar.=I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
I'm not going to take your insolence sitting down!=Your hemorrhoids are flaring up again, eh?
There are no words for how disgusting you are.=Yes there are. You just never learned them.
I've spoken with apes more polite then you.=I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
I've got a long, sharp lesson for you you to learn today.=And I've got a little TIP for you. Get the POINT?
My tongue is sharper then any sword.=First you better stop waving it like a feather-duster.
My name is feared in every dirty corner of this island!=So you got that job as janitor, after all.
My wisest enemies run away at the first sight of me!=Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
Only once have I met such a coward!=He must have taught you everything you know.
If your brother's like you, better to marry a pig.=You make me think somebody already did.
No one will ever catch ME fighting as badly as you do.=You run THAT fast?
I will milk every drop of blood from your body!=How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
My last fight ended with my hands covered with blood.=I hope now you've learned to stop picking your nose.
I hope you have a boat ready for a quick escape.=Why, did you want to borrow one?
My sword is famous all over the Caribbean!=Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all.
I've got the courage and skill of a master swordsman!=I'd be in real trouble if you ever used them.
Every word you say to me is stupid.=I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
You are a pain in the backside, sir!=Your hemorrhoids are flaring up again, eh?
There are no clever moves that can help you now.=Yes there are. You just never learned them.
Now I know what filth and stupidity really are.=I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
I usually see people like you passed-out on tavern floors.=Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
