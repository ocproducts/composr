BLOCK_main_iotd_PARAM_param_TITLE=Method
BLOCK_main_iotd_PARAM_param=Must be either 'current' or 'random'. Default: 'current'. Note: random IOTDs are chosen from the IOTDs which have been used before. This mode is intended for use when IOTDs are getting harder to come by, or when you've had enough for users to not be concerned with re-use. Note that random IOTDs stick for 24 hours due to cacheing (probably a good thing). "Current" uses the IOTD selected in the CMS zone.
