DOC_BOOKING=Each thing that someone can book is added as a 'bookable'. That might be for a ticket to a one off event, or it might be something that is cycled such as a hotel room or a seat at the theatre. Cyclable bookables are booking by the booker booking out one of more dates, where the date might be a single day, a single week, a single month, or a single year, depending on how you set up the bookable.\n\nYou may need to have multiple bookables. For example, if you have different kinds of seat, or different kinds of hotel room, different grades of ticket for an event, or multiple events. If you also have a cyclable that cycles in an unusual way (not just each day, or week, or month, or year) then you may need to add differences instances as different bookables; a great example is if you have a theatre event that happens every Saturday with 3 showings, each 3 showings would be its own bookable, and they'd be set to cycle per week.\n\nYou may want to offer discount options for a bookable. You can do this via 'supplements'. Ordinarily supplements would just be extras the booker can add on, but you can use negative prices to codify concessions (e.g. <abbr title="Old Age Pensioner">OAP</abbr> discount, or child price). You can also enter supplements that represent a general discount but are protected by the need to correctly enter a promo code. Of course, you can also have zero priced supplements that represent choices (such as 'non-smoking room').
