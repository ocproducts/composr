BLOCK_twitter_feed_DESCRIPTION=Show status updates from a Twitter feed.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_USE=You can display a Twitter Feed on your Composr web site.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_consumer_key=Unless the 'Use Twiter Support Config' option is enabled by the site administrator in Setup->Configuration->Block options, you will need to supply your own consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret. You can get your keys and tokens by creating an application on Twitter (http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). The 'Callback URL' field must be set to the web site base URL (for example: http://www.yourdomain.com). When you have saved the app on Twitter, be sure to generate your access tokens (on the Details tab of your app you just created on Twitter), and you will need to change the 'Application type' setting to 'Read and Write' (on the Settings tab of your app you just created on Twitter). If you fill in the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret, this block will use your provided information to authenticate with Twitter. If any of these options are left blank, this block will attempt to use the Composr Twitter Support addon configuration to authenticate with Twitter if the 'Use Twitter Support Config' option is enabled by the site administrator. If it is disabled, you will likely see an authentication error and you will need to create your own app on Twitter to get the necessary keys and tokens to allow this block to authenticate with Twitter. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_consumer_secret=This will also be provided after registering your application on Twitter. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_access_token=This will also be provided after registering your application on Twitter. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_access_token_secret=This will also be provided after registering your application on Twitter. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_screen_name=The Twitter user screen name of the Twitter feed you want to embed. Default: 'coolweens'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_title=The title you want to give to your Twitter feed. (currently not used in the default templates) Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_template_main=If you create your own main template, you can enter the suffix name of your custom main template file. This is the main template where the style template will be added to. Example: if your custom template is named BLOCK_TWITTER_FEED_MyCustomTemplate.tpl, you would enter MyCustomTemplate here. When creating the template, be sure to use the original template file name and append an underscore and your custom name to it. I'm sure it's case sensitive as well. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_template_style=If you create your own style template, you can enter the suffix name of your custom style template file. This is the style template where the actual Twitter provided data will be layed out. Check the 'Twitter Feed Integration Block discussion' topic on the compo.sr Forum for documentation of available template variables. Example: if your custom template is named BLOCK_TWITTER_FEED_STYLE_MyCustomStyle.tpl, you would enter MyCustomStyle here. When creating the template, be sure to use the original template file name and append an underscore and your custom name to it. I'm sure it's case sensitive as well. Default: ''.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_max_statuses=You can specify the maximum number of status updates to show. Minimum value is 1, maximum value is 200 (max allowed by Twitter API). Default: '10'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_show_profile_image=Set this to 1 to show profile image. Set this to 0 to disable profile image. Default: '1'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_twitter_logo_color=This logo is shown in place of the Follow button if the Follow button is disabled per Twitter guidelines. Set this to select a Twitter logo color. 1 = Blue. 2 = Gray. 3 = Black. Default: '1'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_twitter_logo_size=Set this to select a Twitter logo size. 1 = 14x11 pixels. 2 = 32x25 pixels. 3 = 44x35 pixels. Default: '2'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_follow_button_size=Set this to 1 to show smaller (normal size) button. Set this to 2 to show a larger size button. Set this to 0 to disable the follow button. Default: '1'.
BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_style=Set this to the style of output you want. If no style template is manually defined, style can be chosen by one of three styles: 1 = Twitter-like clone, with user profile details. 2 = Full tweets, no user profile details. 3 = Compact but expandable tweets, no user profile details. If you create a simple template, this is ignored. If you create an advanced template, you can set this to a number or name that is referenced in your template file. See the 'Twitter Feed Integration Block discussion' topic on the compo.sr Forum for more documentation. Default: '1'.
CONFIG_OPTION_twitterfeed_update_time=The time in minutes for which the Twitter Feed Integration Block cache lasts. In other words, the Twitter feed is downloaded every X minutes.
CONFIG_OPTION_twitterfeed_use_twitter_support_config=If you enable (check) this option, the block will use the same Twitter API key and secret that is configured for the Twitter Support addon (Admin Zone->Configuration->Feature options->Twitter syndication) if the api_key and api_secret block parameters are blank. If you disable (uncheck) this option, then the Twitter API key and secret must be supplied as block parameters. You can get your key and secret by creating an application on Twitter (http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). The 'Callback URL' field must be set to the web site base URL (for example: http://www.yourdomain.com). When you've saved, you'll need to change the 'Application type' setting to 'Read and Write'. You don't need to create an access token (Composr will negotiate this for you behind-the-scenes).

TWITTER_FEED_INTEGRATION=Twitter Feed Integration Block
