BLOCK_twitter_feed_PARAM_consumer_key=Unless the 'Use Twiter Support Config' option is enabled by the site administrator in Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Block options, you will need to supply your own consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access secret. You can get your keys and tokens by <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new" target="_blank" title="Create application on Twitter (this link will open in a new window)">creating an application on Twitter</a>. The 'Callback URL' field must be set to the web site base URL (for example: <kbd>http://www.yourdomain.com</kbd>). When you have saved the app on Twitter, be sure to generate your access tokens (on the Details tab of your app you just created on Twitter), and you will need to change the 'Application type' setting to 'Read and Write' (on the Settings tab of your app you just created on Twitter). If you fill in the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret, this block will use your provided information to authenticate with Twitter. If any of these options are left blank, this block will attempt to use the Composr Twitter Support addon configuration to authenticate with Twitter if the 'Use Twitter Support Config' option is enabled by the site administrator.
