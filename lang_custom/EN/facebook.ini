[strings]
FACEBOOK_APPID=Facebook app ID
FACEBOOK_SECRET=Facebook app secret
FACEBOOK_UID=Facebook page ID
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_appid=The Facebook app <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> ID/API Key. The Facebook API key is usually referred to as something to build a Facebook app, however it works for our purposes also; <a target="_blank" title="Get an API key for Facebook integration (this link will open in a new window)" href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps/">get an API key</a>. When you create the app make sure the app is configured for the real URL and domain name of your site.
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_secret_code=The Facebook-generated 'secret' associated with your API key.
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_uid=Optional. The Facebook page ID (a number) where syndicated content goes to, and associated to the site via Open Graph. When you authorise Facebook syndication (from the Setup drop-down menu), you must be logged in to a Facebook account (on Facebook's end) that is an administrator of this page. Note that posts to the page will be shown as being from this Facebook account too. If you prefer, you can enter a user ID (for syndicating to a Facebook user's wall) or group ID (for syndicating to a group's wall) into this setting, which will work too, assuming again that you are logged in appropriately on Facebook's end. If you leave this setting blank then when you setup Facebook authorisation it will work out who you are logged in as, and enter that user ID here (i.e. posts will then go to your own wall). If you blank out this option after authorisation, no site-level syndication will occur.

FACEBOOK_SYNDICATION=Facebook syndication / login
DOC_FACEBOOK_SYNDICATION=Set up the website to be able to syndicate content to Facebook, for Facebook users to log in, and for various blocks to be correctly associated to the requisite Facebook page.

FACEBOOK_OAUTH_SUCCESS=Successfully authorised Facebook posting. Applicable posts now show up on your Facebook page/user/group.

FACEBOOK_ALLOW_SIGNUPS=Facebook signup
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_allow_signups=Whether to allow automatic signup via logging in using a Facebook account. If you disable this, member's who already have a Facebook-associated account will need to reset their password to disassociate the account with Facebook.

CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_auto_syndicate=Automatically enable the option to syndicate activities out to Facebook, for users that are logging in with Facebook.
CONFIG_OPTION_facebook_member_syndicate_to_page=Allow a member to choose to syndicate to the configured Facebook page/group rather than their own wall. Only enable this if you have configured Facebook to allow users to post to your page/group, ideally without having to 'like' it first. It is especially important to <em>not</em> enable this if you have put in a Facebook <em>user</em> ID into the &ldquo;Facebook page ID&rdquo; option, as a permission error would then happen.
