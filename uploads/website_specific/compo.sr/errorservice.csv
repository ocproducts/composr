Message,Summary,How did this happen?,How do I fix it?
Table 'xxx' is marked as crashed and should be repaired,MySQL could not serve a Composr database request because it used invalid characters for the database tables it holds.,"Either invalid data is being entered, or you are using a non-default character set in your language pack.

This will only happen with some languages, on some versions/configurations of MySQL.","[b]This is a particularly technical problem. You may prefer to seek help to resolve it.[/b]

Your webhost will almost certainly provide a webhosting control panel with a tool called 'phpMyAdmin' (it may be called something else, such as 'Database management').
1) Access / Log in to this tool
2) Make sure you are in the database that Composr uses
3) Take a backup just in case: Click 'Export', make sure 'Structure' and 'Data' are both ticked (checked), click 'Go' and make sure it properly saves to your computer
3) Go through each table linked in the left frame. For each table...
4) Click 'Operations'.
5) Change the 'Charset' to whatever most closely matches your own language. You may wish to test your change on the table referenced in the error message first."
MySQL client ran out of memory,MySQL could not serve a Composr database request because it ran out of memory.,"Either
 - A database table contains a very large amount of data
 - The server is configured to have a very low limit
 - Your server is overloaded
",Contact your webhost.
The SELECT would examine more than MAX_JOIN_SIZE rows,MySQL could not serve a Composr database request because a configured limit was exceeded.,"Either
 - A database table contains a very large amount of data
 - The server is configured to have a very low limit","There is currently no straight-forward fix to this problem. It may be a bug, or it may be a server configuration problem. Make a judgement call whether to contact your webhost or whether to post on the Composr forum. If you can afford to pay ocProducts can look into the problem under a commercial support arrangement (in which case, open a support ticket)."
Can't open file: 'xxx.MYI',A MySQL data file has corrupted or gone missing on your server.,"Something outside the control of Composr caused this error, such as a hard disk fault, a power surge, a power cut, a forced computer reset, or a system administration mistake.",Contact your webhost. Anticipate that you may need to restore a backed up database.
Lost connection to MySQL server,MySQL was not able to serve a Composr database request.,"There are three likely possible causes:
1) The MySQL server is overloaded
2) The web server is overloaded
3) You have a particularly large amount of data (less likely)",Contact your webhost.
MySQL server has gone away,MySQL was not able to serve a Composr database request.,"There are three likely possible causes:
1) The MySQL server is overloaded
2) The web server is overloaded
3) You have a particularly large amount of data (less likely)",Contact your webhost.
Got packet bigger than 'max_allowed_packet' bytes,MySQL was not able to serve a particularly large Composr database request.,It is likely you're trying to insert a very large amount of data into a Composr entry.,Consider breaking your data over a number of separate entries.
Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database.,"It is likely that either:
1) MySQL is no longer running on the server.
2) The MySQL server is (no longer) running on the same physical server as your web server (""""localhost"""").","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database hostname. Your webhost, or webhosting control panel, likely provides documentation indicating what the correct setting is.

Otherwise, contact your webhost."
Can't connect to MySQL server on xxx,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database.,"It is likely that either:
1) MySQL is no longer running on the server and needs resetting.
2) MySQL is intentionally (no longer) running on the server.
3) Your firewall is blocking the connection between your web server and the MySQL server.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database hostname. Your webhost, or webhosting control panel, likely provides documentation indicating what the correct setting is.

If the MySQL server you are trying to access is on a different computer network to the web server it is likely you will need to use a different MySQL server. Most physical machines running web servers also run MySQL servers, so it is likely you can use 'localhost' as the MySQL server.

Otherwise, contact your webhost."
Access denied for user xxx,"Composr cannot connect to the MySQL server with the configured username and password.

[i]This advice is not relevant if you got the larger error message: Access denied for user xxx to database xxx[/i]","This could happen for a number of reasons:
1) You have configured Composr to use the wrong MySQL username and/or password.
2) The MySQL username and/or password you configured have been changed or removed.
3) You have moved your website to a new web server and not correctly updated the Composr configuration and/or set up your database.
4) If your MySQL server and web server are different physical machines it is important MySQL is configured to allow connections from the web server machine (or all machines) [i]for your configured username[/i]. This is not the default configuration.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong username/password. Your webhosting control panel likely provides documentation an interface where you can configure MySQL usernames and password. Note that on some webhosts you enter a username but it gets given a prefix - if this is the case it should be indicated in the webhosting control panel.

If you have recently changed your MySQL username/password or moved web servers you can edit your configured 'Installation Options'. Call up the '/config_editor.php' script (by URL) and log in to it. You can update your configuration from there.

If your MySQL server and web server are different physical machines then you will need to either change that situation, or make some changes to your MySQL credentials. It may be as simple as choosing to allow 'Any host' to make connections. Some webhosting control panels allow you to change these settings."
Access denied for user xxx to database xxx,Composr cannot connect to the MySQL database with the configured username and password.,"You are likely using correct settings to connect to your database, but MySQL has not been configured correctly.",Make sure that the username you have configured has access to the database you have configured. You will be able to do this from your webhosting control panel. This is not automatic even if the username and database name are the same.
Unknown database xxx,The configured database that Composr should use is not present on the MySQL server.,"This could happen for a number of reasons:
1) You have configured Composr to use the wrong MySQL database.
2) The MySQL database you configured has been renamed or removed.
3) You have moved your website to a new web server and not correctly updated the Composr configuration and/or set up your database.","If you have just moved/installed your website then you likely entered the wrong database name. Your webhosting control panel likely provides documentation an interface where you can manage your MySQL databases. Note that on some webhosts you enter a database name but it gets given a prefix - if this is the case it should be indicated in the webhosting control panel.
You can edit your configured 'Installation Options'. Call up the '/config_editor.php' script (by URL) and log in to it. You can update your configuration from there."
The PHP GD extension on your server is needed to use this feature,Composr is trying to manipulate some graphics but your web server is not capable of doing it in the standard way.,The web server's PHP configuration does not enable the 'GD' extension. It is usually enabled by default.,"Consult with your webhost, or choose a different webhost."
The PHP XML extension on your server is needed to use this feature,"Composr is trying to work with [abbr=""""eXtensible Markup Language""""]XML[/abbr] but your web server is not capable of doing it in the standard way.",The web server's PHP configuration does not enable the 'XML' extension. It is usually enabled by default.,"Consult with your webhost, or choose a different webhost."
The PHP FTP extension on your server is needed to use this feature,Composr is trying to write some files and it does not have access to them.,"To access files for writing Composr needs the server to be configured as 'suEXEC' or it needs to be able to use an [abbr=""""File Transfer Protocol""""]FTP[/abbr] connection to do the work. Neither of these options are available.

[i]Note that this advice is not relevant for Windows servers.[/i]","Consult with your webhost. Let them know you need either:
 - PHP to have the FTP extensions enabled, and an FTP server to be running
 - suEXEC to be enabled (this is a major change for a webhost to implement but ocProducts strongly recommend it)"
"Nothing was selected/chosen, so no operation could be performed",You are trying to do a bulk action but selected nothing to do it on.,You probably did not tick (check) anything before clicking a button.,Go back and make sure you have ticked (checked) something.
"You are using a shared install, which renders this action prohibited",You are trying to do a low-level administrative action but cannot as you are on a shared install.,"You cannot perform certain actions on shared installs, either for security reasons, or because it would impact all other websites.","There is no way around this. If it is a problem for you please discuss it on the Composr forums, or contact ocProducts if you want a professional (commercial) response."

"A critical parameter, xxx, was missing ",An invalid URL was used.,"It is likely part of a URL was missing. The URL was to a real Composr page, but it required some parameters that were not passed. For example, linking to the Composr page/screen-type for viewing downloads without specifying what download to view within the URL.

Some web spiders (automatic programs that read websites) can cause these errors because they will try and guess URLs based on other URLs.
