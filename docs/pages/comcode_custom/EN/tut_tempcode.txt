[title sub="Written by Chris Graham (ocProducts)"]Composr Tutorial: Tempcode programming[/title]

Tempcode is Composr's template programming language. On the simplest level, it provides a substitution mechanism so that parameters and global symbols (like the current user's username, or the time) can be inserted into a template.

It also serves as a complete programming language with support for control structures, built-in core functions and variable substitutions.

[title="2"]Syntax[/title]

The "syntax" of a language is simply the grammar. Tempcode's syntax is extremely simple.

Tempcode provides four constructs other than the plain text of the template itself:
1) [b]Parameters[/b]: [tt]{PARAMETER}[/tt] where PARAMETER is a code-name of something that was actually passed to the template.
2) [b]Language strings[/b]: [tt]{!STRING,<parameters>...}[/tt] where STRING is a real language string from a loaded language file (e.g. Banner code could use strings from banners.ini, but most other code could not; global.ini contains strings usable anywhere).
3) [b]Symbols[/b]: [tt]{$SYMBOL,<parameters>...}[/tt] where SYMBOL is a real symbol Composr supports. Embedding a symbol is like making a function call or running a command in the complex place, or a substitution in the simple case.
4) [b]Directives[/b]: [tt]{+START,DIRECTIVE,<parameters>...}...{+END}[/tt] where DIRECTIVE is a real directive Composr supports. Directives essentially wrap portions of the template, controlling that portion; they are generally used for types of condition checking (e.g. IF) or loops. There are also directives like [tt]{+IMPLODE,<parameters>...}[/tt] that do not wrap, but work outside the normal "string manipulation" bounds that symbols do.

[title="3"]Escaping[/title]

Any of the above 4 Tempcode constructs may be escaped. By "escaped", I mean made to fit in an encoding scheme, such as HTML or URLs, such that special text characters do not interact with that encoding scheme in an insecure/corrupting way). This is done with ease using escaping filters, just by placing the character associated with the mode of escaping before the closing '}'.
For example, [tt]{BLAH*}[/tt] will add the parameter BLAH, escaped for HTML output.

The following escaping filters are provided ([color="green"]green[/color] indicates common usage, [color="red"]red[/color] indicates advanced usage)...

It is absolutely crucial that Tempcode programmers use the proper escaping. Without it, all kinds of insecurities and unreliabilities can develop. About 50% of parameters in the default Composr templates actually use HTML escaping so that plain text placed inside a template does not interfere with the HTML structure itself and displays literally.

If you're wondering what the characters refer to: nothing. They are just characters that are easy to type on a regular keyboard. We like the ability to be able to apply the escapings in this shorthand, in the same way that maths benefits from concise symbolic shorthand.

[title="3"]Escaping Tempcode itself[/title]

Tempcode features a very simple escaping system if you need to output something that looks like Tempcode literally.

It is rare that you actually need escaping, as Tempcode is not going to try and parse every brace it sees, only braces that are succeeded by an alphanumeric character or any of the following characters: [tt]$[/tt] / [tt]+[/tt] / [tt]![/tt] / [tt]_[/tt]. The typical brace used for JavaScript or CSS code is going to be followed by white-space.

The following escaping substitutions work:
 - To escape [tt]{[/tt] use [tt]\{[/tt]
 - To escape [tt]}[/tt] use [tt]\}[/tt]
 - To escape [tt],[/tt] use [tt]\,[/tt]

Backslashes cannot be escaped. So [tt]\\[/tt] will output literally, and [tt]\\{EXAMPLE}[/tt] will output [tt]\{EXAMPLE}[/tt] (i.e. Tempcode will not be triggered because the first slash outputs literally and the second slash escapes Tempcode).
This is intentional: we don't want Tempcode programmers to have to layer escaping schemes, as JavaScript and CSS feature similar backslash-based escaping.
If you really need to output a backslash without it working as an escape character on a succeeding [tt]{[/tt] / [tt]}[/tt] / [tt]_[/tt] character you can use the [tt]{$BACKSLASH}[/tt] symbol. Or, you can drop down to a character-code scheme in the output you're generating (for example, HTML allows output characters using HTML entities, and JavaScript strings support escaped character codes).

[title="3"]The Tempcode tree (advanced)[/title]

Templates are composed together into a tree structure, and then the tree structure is output. This is discussed in further detail in the [page="_SEARCH:tut_structure"]Composr site structure[/page] tutorial.

[title="2"]Philosophy[/title]

Tempcode is quite different from other templating languages, and it's worth covering that.

Most templating languages will try to either:
[list="a"]
[*] use XML, to add programming constructs into the mark-up itself
[*] allow PHP code, or an abstraction of PHP code, to run within the templates
[/list]

Our approach is distinctly different, as we uphold four strong principles:
1) templates should be editable in an HTML editor without Tempcode being broken (although the HTML editor at this time must be able to support 'fragments of HTML')
2) templates should not contain code on the same level as PHP, for security reasons (a theme should not be able to delete files, for instance)
3) there should be a very clear separation of role between templates and code; code should not be put into templates simply because it is convenient, as this muddies the architecture, causing maintenance issues
4) templates should not 'execute': Tempcode should act as a filter/token-placer for output, reshaping output, rather than intertwining code with it. This is again, an architectural issue

[title="3"]Advanced philosophy (experts only)[/title]

For those interested in 'programming language semantics', Tempcode is neither a functional or imperative language, but has aspects of both. A functional language essentially is focused on output being controlled by a complex mathematical expression. An imperative language essentially is focused on output being controlled by a sequence of commands. With Tempcode, output is focused on the stream of text coming from a template, and the composition of these streams; 'symbols' and 'directives' can control, manipulate and add to the stream, but they are more like embedded functional-language function-chains and control-tags than imperative code. Sequences of commands can be simulated by placing symbols and directives next to each other in the output stream and using variable manipulation features to bridge data across the portions of the output stream.

Popular template languages such as 'Velocity' or 'Smarty' are able (and often used) to function in a similar sense to this, but their language design is imperative at core, and the result simply is just far less elegant. Tempcode just 'feels right', with its clean syntax and PHP-separation, while other languages look literally like conventional programming code has been added inside the template in an ad-hoc way (even if the full programming syntax has been simplified a bit).

[title="2"]Placing theme images[/title]

[box="Party like it's 1999" float="right"]
[center][semihtml]
<img src="{$IMG*,under_construction_animated}" alt="Under Construction" title="Under Construction" />
[/semihtml]

(this guy's back must
be really hurting by now)[/center]
[/box]
This is your first practical example of Tempcode, and perhaps the most common use of Tempcode symbols.

To insert an image into your template, use Composr's image symbol: [tt]{$IMG,codename}[/tt]. Replace [tt]codename[/tt] with the image code for the image you want to use. This will turn into the image's URL. Be aware that this does not insert any HTML for you, so to use it fully:
[code="HTML"]<img src="{$IMG*,under_construction_animated}" alt="Under Construction" title="Under Construction" />[/code]
This would insert the image [tt]http://yourbaseurl/themes/default/images/under_construction_animated.png[/tt] into your page, as shown on the right.

The advantage to using the Composr code instead of hand coding the image is two-fold. First, you can have different versions of theme images for different languages and themes. Secondly, if you ever move the image, you don't have to edit every page that ever used it to point to the new location. You can edit images from within the themes management screen (go to Admin Zone > Style > Themes).

[title="2"]Symbols[/title]

[title="3"]Numbers and logic[/title]

Tempcode does not have explicit data-types, everything is text. However we may interpret the text in symbols as follows:
 - Tempcode number: the text is assumed to be a number written as a normal decimal string (e.g. 12345). Numbers should not contain any special formatting other than the British English decimal point (.) symbol.
 - Tempcode boolean: the text is assumed to be 0 (meaning false) or 1 (meaning true). Actually everything other than 1 is considered false.

[title="3"]Further notes[/title]

If a symbol is missing important parameters, it generally is skipped entirely.

Some of the more advanced symbols are not fully laid-out, but they are all defined in [tt]sources/symbols.php[/tt] or [tt]sources/symbols2.php[/tt] in an obvious way, so advanced users can read this file.

You are very unlikely to ever want to use rows in red, as they are intended for use by core Composr code.

					<li>Make sure that Google Translation API is enabled on Google\'s end</li>
					<li>Enable the "Google translate enabled" option (under Admin Zone > Configuration > Site options > Internationalisation)</li>
				</ol>

				<p>To use the symbol just wrap it around text that needs translating in templates, e.g. <kbd>{$PROVIDE_WITH_TRANSLATION,{TEXT},html_block,FR}</kbd>.</p>

				<p>This example translates French in [tt]{TEXT}[/tt] to the site\'s current language, within the context of a block of HTML. The original text is followed by the translated text, and as it is a block of HTML it also includes the "Powered by Google Translate" message.</p>

				<p>Here are the available translation modes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>[tt]plain[/tt] &ndash; translate plain text (without any translation metadata or credit message)</li>
					<li>[tt]html_block[/tt] &ndash; translate a block of HTML (with a [tt]div[/tt] specifying translation metadata and a credit message to Google)</li>

[title="4"]Thumbnail generation[/title]

The [tt]{$THUMBNAIL}[/tt] tag is actually much more sophisticated and powerful than described above. It's full syntax is as follows...

Usage: [tt]{$THUMBNAIL,source_image,widthxheight,output_dir,filename,fallback_image,algorithm,where,background,only_make_smaller}[/tt]
where:
 - [tt]source_image[/tt] is the URL to the full image
 - [tt]widthxheight[/tt] is the desired width/height for the thumbnail. For types (see below) of width or height or crop you can omit either of the width or height for automatically calculated proportionality (e.g. [tt]x20[/tt] for just a height). If you specify both for crop it crops to the exact specified box rather than to the implied proportional box.
 - [tt]output_dir[/tt] is the name of a directory, either under Composr's [tt]uploads[/tt] directory or a longer path relative to the base directory
 - [tt]filename[/tt] is the name of the thumbnail filename. If not provided it will be automatically chosen based on the source_image. An articulation of the thumbnail settings will be prepended to the filename in any case
 - [tt]fallback_image[/tt] is the URL to the image to use if no thumbnail could be generated. If not provided the source_image will be used
 - [tt]algorithm[/tt] is either:
  - [tt]box[/tt] for an image which should be scaled proportionally to fit into the given box dimensions, with no cropping or padding meaning it may be an irregular size (the default)
  - [tt]width[/tt] for an image which is stretched to the given width and a height in proportion to that
  - [tt]height[/tt] for an image which is stretched to the given height and a width in proportion to that
  - [tt]crop[/tt] for an image which has been shrunk until one of its dimensions matched that given and the rest has been chopped off
  - [tt]pad[/tt] for an image which has been shrunk until it completely fits within the given dimensions, and then padded out (padding will only be added if not together the where is 'both' and background is 'none' -- if both & none then it will just make the output image dimensions smaller)
  - [tt]pad_vert_crop_vert[/tt] for an image that may only have cropping or padding done above/below and therefore gets stretched to force that to be the case
  - [tt]pad_horiz_crop_horiz[/tt] for an image that may only have cropping or padding done left/right and therefore gets stretched to force that to be the case
 - The [tt]where[/tt] argument is not needed for [tt]width[/tt] or [tt]height[/tt] type thumbnails. For [tt]crop[/tt] & [tt]pad[/tt] types it is where to *anchor from* when cropping/padding:
  - [tt]both[/tt] (crops/pads around all edges; the default)
  - [tt]start[/tt] (anchors to the lhs/top, therefore padding/cropping to the rhs/bottom)
  - [tt]end[/tt] (anchors to the rhs/bottom, therefore padding/cropping to the lhs/top)
  - [tt]start_if_vertical[/tt] (anchors to the centre/top)
  - [tt]start_if_horizontal[/tt] (anchors to the lhs/centre)
  - [tt]end_if_vertical[/tt] (anchors to the centre/bottom)
  - [tt]end_if_horizontal[/tt] (anchors to the rhs/centre)
 - For [tt]pad[/tt] types the background is used to pad the image:
  - an RGB hex code for a specific colour (optionally with alpha, i.e. RGBA)
  - or, [tt]none[/tt] for no padding (ie. the image dimensions are not those given, but will fit inside them)
  - or, if the option is omitted for padded thumbnails then the average colour of the image is used.
 - [tt]only_make_smaller[/tt] can be set to "1" if the image should not be resized at all if it is already smaller than the requested thumbnail size

[title="3"]Logic[/title]

Note that all logic symbols return Tempcode boolean values (except [tt]?[/tt]). This makes them suitable for nesting with each other, or using with the 'IF' directive.
Understanding of these symbols requires an understanding of basic boolean operations but they are fairly intuitive (e.g. 'AND' will return true if all its parameters are true).

[title="3"]Tempcode variables[/title]

You can store and retrieve values in Tempcode variables. These work across templates, and also work in any-order due to the Composr Tempcode pre-processor (i.e. something can be [tt]SET[/tt] after the [tt]GET[/tt] for it).

[title="2"]Directives[/title]

Note that you cannot use directives for symbol parameters because directives control code flow rather than inline calculations. The way Tempcode logic is internally structured cannot parse/hold it. You can almost always use the <kbd>?</kbd> symbol to guide inline calculations instead.

[title="3"]Directive examples[/title]

The most important directives are:
 - [tt]IF_NON_EMPTY[/tt]
 - [tt]IF_EMPTY[/tt]
 - [tt]IF[/tt]

[title="4"]IF_NON_EMPTY[/title]

This directive is commonly used when a box or explanation needs placing around something, unless that something happens to be blank (empty).
For example, the following is a fairly typical thing to see in a template:
[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF_NON_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
	{DOWNLOADS}
{+END}
[/code]

The [tt]IF_NON_EMPTY[/tt] directive evaluates [tt]{DOWNLOADS}[/tt], to see if it is blank. If it is not blank, the contents of the directive is output, otherwise nothing happens.
As you can see from this example, we need to check for emptiness so we don't show a boxed message about downloads that refers to nothingness.

[title="4"]IF_EMPTY[/title]

An alternative approach to the above example is to include a special message upon emptiness, rather than skipping over. We might do this if the content being displayed is critical and thus the emptiness must be explicitly acknowledged:
[code="HTML"]
<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p class="nothing-here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/code]

Note here how we are displaying [tt]{DOWNLOADS}[/tt] even if it is empty. Obviously if it is empty, nothing would display, so we can get away with it. If we were being pedantic we might have wrote the following:
[code="HTML"]
<p>We have the following downloads:</p>
{+START,IF_NON_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	{DOWNLOADS}
{+END}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}}
	<p class="nothing-here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/code]
and arguably this does better demonstrate what we're trying to do, even though the behaviour is the same (ignoring invisible differences in HTML white-space).

It's often useful to be a bit clever with the emptiness-checking directives. For example:
[code="HTML"]
<p>We have the following downloads and images:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{IMAGES}
{+START,IF_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}{IMAGES}}
	<p class="nothing-here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/code]

In this example, the directive checks if the [tt]{DOWNLOADS}{IMAGES}[/tt] is blank, which is exactly the same as checking if they are both blank (because blank next to blank is still just blank).

[title="4"]IF[/title]

The 'IF' directive allows particular complex calculations to be done. For a simple example, we can replicate the trick in the last example in a more formal way:
[code="HTML"]
<p>We have the following downloads and images:</p>
{DOWNLOADS}
{IMAGES}
{+START,IF,{$AND,{$IS_EMPTY,{DOWNLOADS}},{$IS_EMPTY,{IMAGES}}}}
	<p class="nothing-here">(none)</p>
{+END}
[/code]

This checks to see if "DOWNLOADS is empty and IMAGES is empty".

Tempcode uses what is called a "prefix notation", and is similar to the way you write mathematical functions. For example, in common maths:
[code="Maths"]
f(a,b)
[/code]
is how you would write "evaluate function 'f' with parameters 'a' and 'b'.
In the similar Tempcode notation you would write (assuming 'A' and 'B' are template parameters and 'F' is a real Tempcode symbol):
[code="Tempcode"]
{$F,{A},{B}}
[/code]

Here's another 'IF' directive showing a more complex computation:
[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$LT,{ADD_DATE_RAW},{$SUBTRACT,{$FROM_TIMESTAMP},86400}}}
	<p>This content on {$SITE_NAME} is more than one day old.</p>
{+END}
[/code]

Background: a unix timestamp is a common measurement of time on computers -- it represents the number of seconds since 1970 and because of its nature as a simple decimal number, is very useful for performing arithmetic.
This example checks to see if [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is less than the current unix timestamp minus 86400. 86400 is the number of seconds in a day, so in other words the example checks to see if [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is at least a day in the past. Because [tt]ADD_DATE_RAW[/tt] is often passed into templates that display content, it checks to see if the content is at least a day old.

I threw [tt]{$SITE_NAME}[/tt] into the example just to demonstrate symbols are not only for use in IF directives -- this one is being used to perform a simple placement of the website name. All symbols do is compute results, so those results might be used for further computations as parameters to computational symbols (such as 'SUBTRACT'), or they might be passed into a directive, or they might be simply output. It merely depends on where they are placed.

Tempcode is extremely powerful, and hopefully now you can see how symbols, directives, and parameters, can come together to allow great things to happen!

[box]
See [tt]tempcode_test.txt[/tt] for more examples on how to use symbols and directives.
[/box]

[title="4"]CASES[/title]

[code="Tempcode"]
Capital city:
{+START,CASES,{COUNTRY}}
	UK=London
	Ireland=Dublin
	=Unknown
{+END}
[/code]

Based on the value of "Country", a different value would be shown. We have coded cases for the UK and Ireland, and anything else would default to "Unknown".

Be wary that you can't have multi-line strings for the case sections. This includes not having multi-lines within any of the Tempcode parameters/expressions.

Mode #1 is substring matching:
[code="Tempcode"]
Healthiness:
{+START,CASES,{FOOD_ITEM},1}
	Cake=Unhealthy
	Pie=Unhealthy
	Salad=Healthy
	=Unknown
{+END}
[/code]
(Imagine [tt]FOOD_ITEM[/tt] contains something like [tt]Chocolate Cake[/tt] or [tt]Banoffee Pie[/tt].)

Mode #2 is regular expression matching:
[code="Tempcode"]
Head of state:
{+START,CASES,{COUNTRY},2}
	^(Canada|Australia|United Kingdom)$=King/Queen
	^USA$=POTUS
	=Unknown
{+END}
[/code]

[title="2"]Encapsulation[/title]

You can encapsulate Tempcode within comments of other languages, in order to not break editor syntax highlighting, and so WYSIWYG editors don't corrupt the code.

Examples...

HTML comments...
[code="HTML"]
<!-- {+START,IF,{$MOBILE}} -->
Example
<!-- {+END} -->
[/code]

CSS comments...
[code="CSS"]
/* {+START,IF,{$MOBILE}} */
Example
/* {+END} */
[/code]

HTML attributes...
[code="HTML"]
<span x-tempcode-1="{+START,IF,{$MOBILE}}" class="mobile" x-tempcode-2="{+END}">Example</span>
[/code]

[title="2"]Detailed worked examples[/title]

This section will provide real-world examples of using Tempcode. It goes into a minimal amount of PHP programming to provide a context for using a new template file and a context as to how Comcode pages, blocks, and templates, hold together. It explains things in terms of direct file editing rather than editing using the forms within Composr.

If you are not comfortable with creating new code files you may want to glance over those parts. Ordinary themers would normally work by editing existing template files, or by placing Tempcode directly onto Comcode pages.

[title="3"]Creating a new block[/title]

Lets start by adding a new sample block to our front page so that we can test different examples of Tempcode. Go to the [tt]sources_custom/blocks[/tt] folder and create and add a new empty file named [tt]main_first_block.php[/tt].

Now lets add something to our block file. Edit [tt]main_first_block.php[/tt] using your favorite text editor and add the following:
[code="PHP"]
<?php

class Block_main_first_block
{
	function run()
	{
		return do_template('BLOCK_MAIN_FIRST_BLOCK',array());
	}
}
[/code]

In this code we are simply creating a new class for our block and then defining the standard [tt]run()[/tt] method which is executed when the block is invoked. We are calling a template file [tt]BLOCK_MAIN_FIRST_BLOCK.tpl[/tt] in the [tt]run()[/tt] method using the [tt]do_template()[/tt] function. This tells the system to use this template file for our block. Our next step is creating a template file for the block.

[title="3"]Creating a template file[/title]

Go to the [tt]themes/default[/tt] folder. There you should find two main templates folder [tt]templates[/tt] and [tt]templates_custom[/tt]. The main [tt]templates[/tt] folder has all the predefined templates which the system is using already (&dagger;) so we don't have to make any changes there. The [tt]templates_custom[/tt] folder will have all the user defined templates or the customised templates, so our template file will go there.
Create a new blank file [tt]BLOCK_MAIN_FIRST_BLOCK.tpl[/tt] and save it in to [tt]templates_custom[/tt]. [tt].tpl[/tt] is the default extension we give to template files.

&dagger; Actually this isn't quite true. The [tt]css[_custom][/tt], [tt]javascript[_custom][/tt] and [tt]text[_custom][/tt] folders also hold templates. Even CSS files are handled as templates in Composr.

[title="3"]Adding the block to front page[/title]

Now that we have the block and template file ready, lets add the block to our front page so that we can test the examples. To add a block to the front page we will have to make the changes in the Comcode file [tt]start.txt[/tt] which contains all the blocks which show up on the front page.
[tt]start.txt[/tt] file is located in [tt]pages/comcode_custom/EN[/tt] (the same rule as templates applies here as well, i.e. the customised Comcode files should go in to [tt]_custom[/tt] folder).

[media width="150" description="Our empty box" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp1.png[/media]
Edit [tt]start.txt[/tt] file using your text editor, and add this on the end:
[code="Comcode"]
[box="first block"][block]main_first_block[/block][/box]
[/code]

This Comcode adds the block to our front page.

The box defines the outer section of the block and the string parameter passed to it ("first block") will be placed in the title of our box. We could have instead done the box inside the template using Tempcode or direct HTML if we had chosen to, but we wanted to mix some extra Comcode in with our example too.

The block tag includes our new block. Within the block tags we have provided the name of our new block, [tt]main_first_block[/tt].

If you go to your front page now you should see that a new box has been added with the title "first block" on the top. The box is empty right now as we are yet to add any content to the [block's] template file,

Now that we have a block set up on the front page, we can Test some Tempcode examples here by simply adding code to our template file ([tt]BLOCK_MAIN_FIRST_BLOCK.tpl[/tt]).

Let's proceed to our first example...

[title="3"]Set randomisation example[/title]

[media width="150" description="Set randomisation example" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp2.png[/media]
This example demonstrates how a built-in Tempcode construct, the [tt]SET_RAND[/tt] symbol, can be used to randomly make a selection from given options.

Go ahead and paste the following example code into our [tt]BLOCK_MAIN_FIRST_BLOCK.tpl[/tt] file and reload the front page to see the results.

[code="HTML"]
<p style="color: {$SET_RAND,red,green,blue,#EE1167};">
	I think you are a {$SET_RAND,lovely,beautiful,groovy} person.<br />
	We randomly selected a word, and randomly picked a text colour.
</p>
[/code]

(Caching should not be an issue as our test block has not defined any block caching, and (assume you haven't disabled it) the smart cache should detect the template has changed.)

This would resolve to some HTML such as:
[code="HTML"]
<p style="color: green">
	I think you are a groovy person.<br />
	We randomly selected a word, and randomly picked a text colour.
</p>
[/code]

[title="3"]Number randomisation example[/title]

[media width="150" description="Number randomisation example. We had to refresh a few times to see this, because as expected it was empty 3/4 of the time." float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp6.png[/media]
In this example we use the symbol [tt]RAND[/tt] to pick a random number between 0 and 3 and the number. This number will then be passed to an [tt]IF[/tt] directive that checks if the number is less than 1 using the [tt]LT[/tt] symbol. Go ahead and try this in the template file to see the results.

[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$LT,{$RAND,3},1}}
	<p>
		This shows 1/4 of the time. How does it work? RAND picks a random number between 0 and 3, so the number will be less than 1 1/4 of the time.
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

[title="3"]Obfuscation example[/title]

Tempcode is also equipped with security features such as obfuscating an e-mail, getting an obfuscated [tt]mailto:[/tt] string which makes it hard for e-mail scavengers to read it -- hence preventing spam.

[code="HTML"]
<p>
	I want to let people {$OBFUSCATE,mailto:me@example.com}, but I don't want spam so I will confuse spam-bots.
</p>
[/code]

[title="3"]Truncation example[/title]

The [tt]TRUNCATE_LEFT[/tt] symbol can be used to trim data from the left, the [tt]TRUNCATE_RIGHT[/tt] symbol to do the same from right, and the [tt]TRUNCATE_SPREAD[/tt] symbol to keep an equal left/right portion.

All the three functions have the same parameter order, which is as follows:
[code="Tempcode"]
{$TRUNCATE_LEFT, data, truncation length, optional binary value to show a tool tip, optional binary value for whether the input text is already in HTML format}
[/code]

[code="HTML"]
<p>
	{$TRUNCATE_LEFT,Sometimes you get data that is too long for your layout.,10,1,1}
</p>
[/code]

[title="3"]Match-key example[/title]

[media width="150" description="Match-key example, running from front page (nothing would be seen if we placed the block on another page)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp7.png[/media]
We can use that to show a specific message only if a match-key is satisfied.

A match-key is basically the same thing as a page-link. The only difference is that a match-key is used for matching and will also match any page-links with additional parameters not mentioned in the match-key -- i.e. the match is performed against the parameters in the match-key, all other parameters are ignored. As you are probably already comfortable with the term "page-link", we'll use that henceforth.

[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$MATCH_KEY_MATCH,site:example}}
	<p>
		I want this displayed only for the example page<br />
		(the page-link means "'site' zone, 'example' page)
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

You can test this next example in the [tt]DOWNLOAD_CATEGORY_SCREEN.tpl[/tt] file:
[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$MATCH_KEY_MATCH,site:downloads:browse:3}}
	<p>
		Maybe I want to add this message to DOWNLOAD_CATEGORY_SCREEN.tpl but to only display if viewing download category 3.<br />
		(the page-link means "'site' zone, 'downloads' page, 'browse' screen type, '3' ID)
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

This is an alternative way of achieving the same result as above. We perform a string equality (using the [tt]EQ[/tt] symbol) on the [tt]id[/tt] parameter; if it is equal then the message will be displayed.

[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$EQ,{$_GET,id},3}}
	<p>
		Or we could do it this way, given DOWNLOAD_CATEGORY_SCREEN.tpl is always under site:downloads:browse anyway, and the 'id' parameter is the only thing altering.
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

[title="3"]User-agent detection example[/title]

It's sometimes useful to know which browser is being used by the user to view the web page. We might have to make some tweaks specifically for browsers like Internet Explorer to ensure cross-browser compatibility -- or perhaps we want to give out messages to users to tell them to upgrade their browsers. Ideally we would never have to do this, but the world of web browsers is kind of the wild-west, and things are always advancing and changing.

[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$BROWSER_MATCHES,ie}}
	<p>
		You're an Internet Explorer user.
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

[title="3"]Admin check example[/title]

[media width="150" description="Admin check example (we're logged in as admin so we do see it)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp3.png[/media]
This example shows how we could display messages or alerts specifically for admins.

[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$IS_ADMIN}}
	<p>
		Only admins see this.
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

[title="3"]Group membership example[/title]

This functionality is similar to the above [tt]IS_ADMIN[/tt], but it works by usergroup. If the member belongs to any of usergroups 1, 3, 4 or 5, then the message will be displayed.

[media width="150" description="Group membership example (viewed from a test user in one of these usergroups)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp4.png[/media]
[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$IS_IN_GROUP,1,3-5}}
	<p>
		Only members in groups 1/3/4/5 see this.
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

(here we used [page="_SEARCH:tut_selectcode"]Selectcode[/page] to show how we can do a range)

[title="3"]Guest check example[/title]

This example shows different content to guests and non-guests:
[code="HTML"]
{+START,IF,{$IS_GUEST}}
	<p>
		Only guests see this.
	</p>
{+END}
{+START,IF,{$NOT,{$IS_GUEST}}}
	<p>
		Only non-guests see this (you are {$USERNAME*}).
	</p>
{+END}
[/code]

[title="3"]Thumbnail example[/title]

This example is dynamically changing the image resolution of your avatar, using the [tt]THUMBNAIL[/tt] symbol and the [tt]AVATAR[/tt] symbol. The second parameter of the [tt]THUMBNAIL[/tt] symbol defines the resolution we are generating.

[code="HTML"]
<img alt="Your avatar made into a really tiny thumbnail" title="Your avatar made into a really tiny thumbnail" src="{$THUMBNAIL*,{$AVATAR},20x20}" />
[/code]

[title="3"]Zebra striping example[/title]

[media width="150" description="Zebra striping example" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_tempcode/poweroftemp5.png[/media]
This example shows some zebra striping, within a set of boxes put out by a loop.

We can use loops within Tempcode using the [tt]LOOP[/tt] directive, and the loop variable can be fetched within the loop using the [tt]_loop_var[/tt] parameter.

This example is not about loops; we just use loops as a way of putting out multiple boxes -- really we are trying to show how zebra striping can work. Zebra striping can also work between multiple attached instances of the same template, which is a far more common example, but would have been a bit harder for us to demonstrate via sample code.

In this example, it loops from A to I and in the loop it uses the [tt]CYCLE[/tt] symbol to go through the parameters passed to it (two colours) in a sequence. The first loop iteration will result in a [tt]div[/tt] element with a background property set to the first value (i.e [tt]#EEE[/tt]) and [tt]_loop_var[/tt] will display the current loop value for that (i.e. A). Then it proceeds through the loop, but the cycle is repeating between just two values (our zebra stripes) even though the loop goes on for nine values.

[code="HTML"]
<div>
	Zebra-striping by setting up a named cycle (we use the loop to simulate an arbitrary repeating situation to use the cycle within):
	{+START,LOOP,A\,B\,C\,D\,E\,F\,G\,H\,I}
		<div style="background: {$CYCLE,bgcol,#EEE,#AAA}">
			{_loop_var}
		</div>
	{+END}
</div>
[/code]

[title="2"]GUIDs[/title]

There is a design issue that comes to us when we design template structure... do we re-use templates so that editing is easier, load is decreased, and consistency is raised; or do we allow maximum customisation of different aspects of the system by not re-using templates?
We have tended to stick to a middle ground between these extremes, and re-used templates when the usage pattern was almost identical. For example, almost all of Composr uses the same form field templates, but Wiki+ posts use different templates to forum posts. However, there are still places where we re-use templates in situations that sites may wish to develop in separate directions.

The solution to this is to make use of the GUID each template usage is given when it is used.
Each [tt]do_template[/tt] call in Composr, which loads up a template, passes in a parameter, [tt]_GUID[/tt]. The GUIDs may then be used along with tempcode directives to control what the template outputs.
The template editor has special support for the GUIDs, showing what GUIDs a template is used with and providing links to view the code associated with each GUID. It also provides a feature to automatically insert an 'IF' directive that differentiates against one of the GUIDs to provide a place to put output that will only be shown for it.

If you enter the template editor from the 'Template tree' screen then you will be told the GUID that was used by the node in the tree that you selected.

 3_key="Directive"        3_value="A tool used to surround an area of a template between a START and an END, to apply something to it (such as only using it conditionally)"
 4_key="Variable"         4_value="A named piece of memory used by Tempcode symbols that manipulate variables, or informally some internal other piece of Composr memory that Tempcode has a way of accessing"
 5_key="Construct"        5_value="A Tempcode symbol, parameter, or language reference"
