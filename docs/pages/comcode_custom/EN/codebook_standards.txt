[title="2"]Introduction[/title]

This document documents many coding standards. Agencies may wish to integrate this into their own assessment spreadsheet for projects.

Ideally you should try and learn to apply all these standards naturally, so going through this as a checklist will be a quick final formality when you're finished coding.

You may also wish to read the "Engineering standards and trade-off" section of [page="_SEARCH:codebook_3"]Code Book, part 3 (Miscellany)[/page] and the descriptions of design concerns across the main compo.sr website.

[title="2"]What standards to apply[/title]

If you are writing code that will be included in future Composr versions (often code for client sites by ocProducts is, if it's a nice clean reusable feature), you must meet the full standards.

For client work you can afford to meet only a subset of standards, as you control the environment much more, and a limited set of programmers will need to work with the code. Team members can agree on the standards used on a per-project basis.

We want to maintain high standards, but we also don't want to weigh you down.

The categories:
 - "All development" should be done by any developer using Composr
 - "Composr development +" means it's needed for Composr code (i.e. code for redistribution to end users), but also very advisable to do in general (it's best to try and learn to do it by habit if it's something that doesn't make things slower to do).
 - "Product only" only usually needs considering for bundled Composr code, although you may want to consider it anyway.
 - "Projects" applies only to client projects, not for the normal coding of bundled Composr code.

[title="2"]Automatic application[/title]

Any standard not marked in [color="red"]red[/color] has some kind of automatic way of being checked, assuming all the recommended tools are used.

[title="3"]Development mode[/title]

The mentioned Composr development mode runs automatically if you are working out of a git repository.

[title="3"]Code Quality Checker[/title]

The Code Quality Checker (described in the Code Book, and its [tt]readme.txt[/tt] file) has various options, including pedantic mode. When we refer to pedantic mode here we might actually mean one of the other non-default options: check to see what's available.

[title="3"]Automated tests[/title]

Automated tests are implemented as "unit tests" in the [tt]testing_platform[/tt] addon. Technically they are not actually unit tests, they are integration tests, but we aren't pedantic about that.

Almost any rule has exceptions, and thus many of the tests define lists of exceptions internally, which you are invited to amend as required. Use your common sense and good judgement.

Many automated tests support a [tt]debug=1[/tt] parameter to output additional debug information for why things are failing.

You are invited to improve automated test code as you see fit.

[title="3"]Code formatting within editors[/title]

To automatically format code for PSR-2 you can either use the "PHP-CS-Fixer" Open Source project, or ideally PhpStorm. PHP-CS-Fixer has some bugs and can't clean everything (especially argument spacing) but generally does a serviceable job.

The optimum PHP-CS-Fixer command is:
[code="Bash"]
php-cs-fixer fix --fixers=indentation,phpdoc_params,visibility,braces,lowercase_constants,function_declaration,controls_spaces,eof_ending,standardize_not_equal,elseif,lowercase_keywords,php_closing_tag,short_tag,object_operator,trailing_spaces,linefeed,encoding,concat_with_spaces,operators_spaces .
[/code]

It is a good idea to use an editor/IDE with support for the [tt].editorconfig[/tt] standard. Most editors/IDEs have a plugin for it. [tt].editorconfig[/tt] will help you automatically set correct tab settings (among other things) as you move between different projects.

|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Manually
| Don't copy & paste big chunks of code (exceptions: see below), or the same snippet of code time-and-time-again. If you spot a reusable chunk of code, consider making both usages work via a new shared function. Sometimes if you see the same [b]pattern[/b] of code time-and-time-again it makes sense to abstract that too.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Only ever copy & paste if you need to, and use care[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Manually
| If you do copy & paste a chunk of code, e.g. if implementing a new importer and using a pre-existing one as a base -- then make sure you at least adjust your copied code to make sense. Don't leave comments in there that refer to the old context (e.g. refer to the wrong importer in the pasted code).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Know what you are doing in all your code[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Manually
| Understand all the code you write. Don't just copy some existing pattern into a new context.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Write well structured code[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Code Quality Checker can check function length (pedantic mode)
| Divide into functions into appropriate units (sensible modules interacting over reasonable interfaces). Where possible create functions and classes that are isolated from specific screens, as these can then have automated tests written for them. Try and make your code flow from top to bottom roughly represent execution order.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Keep your code tidy[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Manually
| Just generally try and keep your code neat. Don't misspell in comments and variable names. Tidy code encourages a mindset of zero tolerance for messiness in other areas, and increases general team morale such as to keep a high level of standards. See [url="Broken Windows Theory"]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory[/url].
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Separate code chunks with blank lines[/color]
| Technical debt
| Product development only
| Manually
| A chunk of code is usually a few lines long and does a common purpose. Usually the chunk will start with a short comment, and end with a single blank line or a function's closing brace. Make your blank lines mean something (i.e. the end of a code chunk), don't just add them to space things out randomly.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Keep track of things you intend to fix later[/color]
| Technical debt: stops things being forgotten
| All development
| Manually
| If you have to do some code that really should be cleaner, put a comment by it starting [tt]FUDGE[/tt]. If you haven't finished something put a comment starting [tt]TODO[/tt] (with optional reference to a tracker ID which will suppress it reporting as a test failure), so it is easy for someone to later pick up if you forgot to finish it. If you have an idea put [tt]IDEA[/tt] (with optional reference to a tracker ID).
We do not use [tt]HACKHACK[/tt] or [tt]FIXME[/tt] markers, although the CQC will pick up on these.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Any legacy code must be marked as such[/color]
| Technical debt
| Product development only
| Manually
| Legacy code, due to supporting data from old Composr versions, must be marked with a [tt]LEGACY[/tt] comment. This will allow us to clean it out in future versions, should we want to break old compatibility.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Don't write cryptic code[/color]
| Technical debt
| All development
| Manually
| Don't write code that is too "clever" or relies on too deep an understanding, unless there's good reason to. For example, don't assume the programmer knows the precedence order of some of the less common operators so put in explicit brackets to make things clear.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use software engineering best practices[/color]
| Technical debt
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use software engineering best practices (while also keeping things consistent with how Composr is designed, sometimes unconventional decisions may have been made for a reason).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use meaningful function / class / variable / file / identifier names[/color]
| Technical debt
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use sensible function / class / variable / file / identifier / token names that make full intuitive sense in whatever context they are used in; this is particularly important for global functions (you should have an idea what specifically the function is for without having to look it up).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Comment your code, but not too much
| Technical debt
| Composr development +
| Code Quality Checker can check comment density (pedantic mode)
| Write comments for non-obvious code. Don't comment obvious things ("this is a loop", "this runs if $foo equals $bar"). Write comments that explain your algorithms, and comments that give a high-level overview of what chunks of code do. Very roughly one of two comments per 7 lines, but don't feel bound to match that.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Write comments in the standard way
| Consistency
| Product development only
| Manually
| Comments typically look like [tt]// This is an example[/tt]. Notice the [tt]//[/tt] commenting method is used, followed by a space, followed by a capital letter. There are many special cases for why you would not do it like this, but generally speaking you should follow this format. This will make the code look neat and tidy, rather than comments looking like rough notes.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use constants instead of "magic numbers"[/color]
| Technical debt
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Don't use "magic numbers". For example, instead of using the numbers 1, 2, and 3 with special meanings throughout your code, define constants and reference those instead.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Everything should be configurable from within Composr[/color]
| Usability for webmasters
| Product development only
| Manually
| No FTP/file-manager should ever be necessary to operate, configure, or extend an installed Composr website.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use our standard code header[/color]
| Legal
| Product development only
| Manually
| We have a standard comment format at the top of files (different depending on the file type). Use it consistently.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Prefer long lines over forced line-breaks[/color]
| Consistency
| Product development only
| Manually
| Generally we prefer code to fit on the screen without scrolling, but don't force it by breaking up and indenting lines in a way that doesn't align with structure. It is better to have symmetrical looking code than forced breaks, especially given text editors can have automatic word-wrapping enabled when desired. Often you can break up code in a clean way by pre-computing function arguments, or neatly indenting array or parameter structures.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Pass URLs properly[/color]
| Compatibility with ModSecurity
| Product development only
| Manually
| URLs-within-URLs need to be encoded carefully so as to bypass ModSecurity restrictions (often any embedded URL is blocked). Basically URLs should be read in with a [tt]INPUT_FILTER_URL_*[/tt] flag to [tt]*_param_string[/tt], and URLs should be placed within URLs/forms with a [tt]protect_url_parameter[/tt] call around their value.

Blank lines at the end of files

| Automated test ([tt]basic_code_formatting.php[/tt])
| There is a Unix standard that text files should have a terminating line break. As various tools enforce this we standardise on a single line-break for most files. A few exceptions are defined within the automated test for the rare cases where we can't do this.

Use ASCII
| Stability
| Composr development +
| Automated test ([tt]basic_code_formatting.php[/tt])
| In order to avoid having to configure IDEs and text editors on what character set to use, and problems with Composr running on different character sets, just make it so your files don't require any specific character set. This is not a strict rule, but certainly don't have your code outputting non-ASCII characters directly if utf-9 isn't being used -- encode such characters in some smarter way, e.g. using HTML entities. The actual text files are saved utf-8.
|}

[title="3"]Back-end programming[/title]

You do not need to make third-party libraries meet our particular choice of standards. We trust third-party developers to have their own methods for ensuring standards are high. Exclude PHP files from automated testing by putting [tt]/*CQC: No check*/[/tt] (disables the CQC) and/or [tt]/*CQC: No API check*/[/tt] (disables the CQC's PHPDoc scanning/compilation) at the top of the file.

Use PSR-2 coding standard
| Consistency
| Composr development +
| Code Quality Checker, Autoformatting in PhpStorm
| Use PSR-2, e.g. the bracing style, 4-spaces not tabs. Our only exceptions are relating to:
 - class and namespace structure, as we are not an OOP-heavy codebase
 - we allow long lines
 - don't split function/method declarations across multiple lines
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Spaces around operators
| Consistency
| Product development only
| Code Quality Checker
| Do like [tt]$a + $b[/tt] not [tt]$a+$b[/tt]. This makes the code easier to read and understand for some programmers, and largely consistent with what other projects do.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Trailing commas for multi-line arrays[/color]
| Revision control
| Product development only
| Code Quality Checker
| If you have split an array or JavaScript object initialiser across multi-lines, use a trailing comma. This means every array element has a comma after it. The advantages are it looks more symmetrical and it is less likely to conflict in revision control should the array be extended with further elements.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Align functions precisely in code
| Modularity: So Composr code-overriding can work on it
| Composr development +
| Automated test ([tt]override_issues.php[/tt])
| Functions must not be indented in code, and methods must be indented by exactly 4 spaces. There must be exactly one space after the [tt]function[/tt] keyword and no tabs. Braces must go on the next line with the same indentation as the function and the closing brace must match too. The contents of the function must be 4 spaces deeper.
These rules are very standard, but if broken then code-overriding may not work correctly because Composr assumes them while doing efficient function-level overriding (there is no full PHP parser involved).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use Composr APIs wherever appropriate[/color]
| Security, stability, consistency
| Composr development +
| Manually
| If is very easy to make mistakes when writing new code. Our functions have been tuned over years. For example, our [tt]http_get_contents[/tt] function works on any server and supports lots of options.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use the [tt]temporal[/tt] API, not PHP date/time functions[/color]
| Internationalisation / consistency
| All development
| Manually
| Don't forget about users potentially being in different timezones. Rarely if ever use PHP's inbuilt date/time functions -- use Composr's temporal API.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use the [tt]type[/tt] parameter for your modules[/color]
| URL schemes
| All development
| Manually
| All modules should be coded to use [tt]type[/tt] as the internal specifier of what 'screen' to show. The [tt]run[/tt] function should decide what function to call based on this parameter, and typically also the [tt]run_pre[/tt] function will be there to load metadata for the screen (allows HTML to start streaming while the screen code runs). The default entry point for a module must either not exist, or be named [tt]browse[/tt]. Do not hardcode defaults other than [tt]browse[/tt] as it will interfere with the page-link permission security and the URL scheme support.
|-

[color="red"]Export metadata[/color]
| Standards compliance
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Export metadata using [tt]seo_meta_load_for[/tt] and [tt]set_extra_request_metadata[/tt] for content modules supporting it.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Remember to apply sorting wherever appropriate[/color]
| Usability: so live sites are tidy
| All development
| Manually
| Remember to sort things. Sometimes this needs doing in PHP code, and sometimes it needs doing in your queries ([tt]ORDER BY[/tt]). If doing it in PHP code consider you usually will want to do a "natural" sort. Typically you should order data records by date, not by ID (because IDs may not be sequential, especially on exotic database backends). You should never assume that data comes out of the database in the same order as it goes in.
|-

[color="red"]Remember to apply pagination wherever appropriate[/color]
| Performance

|-

[color="red"]Performance over architecture[/color]
| Performance: on real live sites
| All development
| Manually
| We put performance ahead of what other's may consider strong architecture -- we don't create complex or abstractions or heavy code structures for core code to keep our framework's footprint low. Latency and memory usage is very important, and we don't want to make the same overhead mistakes other systems have made.

Use unique function and class names
| Modularity: you may need to load up both at some point
| All development
| Code Quality Checker
| No two classes or functions may have the same name, regardless of where they are defined or used. It should be possible for the whole set of Composr PHP files to be simultaneously loaded.
|-

[color="red"]Don't rely on "Security through obscurity"[/color]
| Security
| All development
| Manually
| Always assume that people will try and hack the website, and that they have the full source code, so don't rely on them not guessing URL parameters etc. For example, if you implement some kind of permission scheme for a feature, don't just limit how the link to the feature is shown, also limit the interface and actualiser functions for the feature.

[color="red"]Be careful with: [tt]header()[/tt], [tt]eval()[/tt], [tt]preg_replace()[/tt][/color]
| Security
| All development
| Manually, Code Quality Checker pedantic mode will help
| If you're putting variables into the header function consider data could contain [tt]\r[/tt] or [tt]\n[/tt] symbols, so escape via the [tt]escape_header[/tt] function. If you're using eval be [b]extremely[/b] careful to validated input; there's rarely a reason to use it anyway. If you're using [tt]preg_replace[/tt] make sure to use [tt]preg_quote[/tt] and to manually escape the regular expression encapsulation character (usually [tt]#[/tt] or [tt]/[/tt]).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
Avoid using [tt]eval[/tt], [tt]$$[/tt], [tt]create_function[/tt], or [tt]preg_replace[/tt] with [tt]/e[/tt]

[color="red"]Any page should be accessible as standalone[/color]
| Usability
| All development
| Manually
| You shouldn't add modules that are never intended to be used independently, because they will come up on the sitemap. If you intend to write some kind of helper script that may be called by a module then either use an "entry-point script" for that or build the functionality into the module file itself (you are allowed to [tt]exit[/tt] out of a module with your own HTTP headers etc rather than returning Tempcode).
|-

[color="red"]Make your code robust against accessed deleted content[/color]
| Stability
| All development

| Usability
| Product development only
| Manually
| Show the appropriate maximum-upload size on all screens that support file uploads, unless the size is very unlikely to be reached by the user (e.g. just uploading an avatar). Composr has a standard mechanism to do this, which can be automated within CRUD modules. For code examples search the code for [tt]get_upload_limit_config_url[/tt].

[color="red"]Use our MVC model as described in the Code Book[/color]
| Technical debt
| Composr development +
| Manually, Code Quality Checker will help
| Composr enforces a strict separation between content, presentation and code. This is referred to as the MVC (model, view, controller) design pattern. No HTML is allowed in the PHP code except for very select exceptions, such as [tt]<option>[/tt] (for efficiency) and hardcoded emergency error pages. You can usually assume the output will be some kind of HTML though (you don't need to code so abstractly that output could be a speech API, for example).

| Composr development +
| Code Quality Checker
| Never assume that any extensions are installed unless they are listed in Composr's [page="_SEARCH:tut_webhosting"]minimum requirements[/page]. If you do use something else (necessarily so, and only for auxiliary behaviour) you must cleanly handle the situation where it is not present using either code branching or helpful error messages.

| Don't copy and paste GUIDs in template calls. If you copy and paste a line with a GUID ([tt]'_GUID' => 'blahblahblah'[/tt]), remove it completely from your new line. Our automated scripts can put one back in later. The reason: these are used to allow different uses of shared templates to be differentiated via Tempcode. The GUID is a unique identifier for a specific template call.

[color="red"]Use existing conventions and features and re-use templates where possible[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability, performance, themeing
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Generally try and replicate the interface conventions of existing modules, unless there is a strong argument that you are dealing with a special case. For example, don't design new ways of previewing things, use the standard previewing mechanism. Another example, use the [tt]pagination[/tt] function instead of implementing new previous/next navigation code. There are almost always API functions or templates for you to use, so it's actually easier to use conventions than re-implementing from scratch. Some are listed further down.
|-

[color="red"]Define breadcrumbs in the standard way[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability for webmasters
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use [tt]breadcrumb_set_self[/tt] / [tt]breadcrumb_set_parents[/tt] as required to generate appropriate breadcrumb chains. Try to do it at the start of screen code, so it'll be set if an error happens during screen generation.
|-

[color="red"]Inline edit links[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability for webmasters
| Composr development +
| Manually
| For viewing content: if someone has permission to edit something, then for the template that shows the content, pass in a parameter called [tt]EDIT_URL[/tt] (typically), containing the URL to edit the content. If the user doesn't have edit permission, then pass in [tt]EDIT_URL[/tt] empty. Use the standard [tt]STAFF_ACTIONS[/tt] include method for displaying any actions within the template (see the [tt]DOWNLOAD_SCREEN[/tt] template for an example).

| A CMS/Admin module's functions should generally be divided by a welcoming do-next manager (i.e. a set of icons). Exceptions include: when adding only involves specifying a single field (in which case you can put add and edit on the same screen), and also when adding is for power-users only (in which case the add form would be hidden behind a button). Follow the conventions other modules use.

| Composr development +
| Manually
| Don't duplicate interface elements in Composr, unless the duplicate is clearly marked as some kind of shortcut/dupe/jump. For example, if there is a shortcut link between two modules (a duplication in navigation), use the standard Composr convention for informing the user they are jumping between modules (for an example, see how the link from the "Manage themes" screen to the "Zones" screen works).

|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, access-denied screens[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use the [tt]access_denied[/tt] function as appropriate. It can be passed a language code, or a string. For Composr development, it should be a language code, so that the logs may be internationalised.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, Fatal/Warn/Inform exit/screen[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| For full-screen messaging. Use the [tt]whatever_screen[/tt] or [tt]whatever_exit[/tt] function. Specify the appropriate [tt]$type[/tt] of the message.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, Fatal/Warn/Inform attached message[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| For response-embedded messaging where the code isn't failing per-se, but it's more like a predictable messaging situation occurred. Use the [tt]attach_message[/tt] function for this. Specify the appropriate [tt]$type[/tt] of the message. Logging is optional.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, trigger a PHP-level error[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| For response-embedded messaging of something that really is a kind of unexpected failure. Use the [tt]trigger_error[/tt] function for this. Ultimately Composr will also call [tt]attach_message[/tt], and log the error.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, include the [tt]WARNING_BOX[/tt] template[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Places an on-screen warning about the action or content that a screen is providing. More contextualised than [tt]attach_message[/tt] but requires a predetermined place for it within the template you're embedding into.
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Where appropriate, inline errors[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use one of the standard CSS classes, such as [tt]nothing-here[/tt] or [tt]red-alert[/tt] or [tt]inline-wip-message[/tt] to mark the error using standard Composr styles. Generally this logic will be performed deep within templates or when a block has to terminate with a clean error.

| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use a standard form template such as [tt]FORM_SCREEN[/tt] (most cases) or [tt]FORM[/tt] (if the form is just part of a complex screen). These templates provide automatic client-side field validation; server-side field validation is provided automatically also, via the standard field retrieval functions (e.g. [tt]post_param_string[/tt]).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use the form field API to generate input fields[/color]

[color="red"]Use the standard method to split up large forms[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Split complex forms into groups by using the [tt]FORM_SCREEN_FIELD_SPACER[/tt] template to separate them. Hide groups of advanced functionality that is not often needed (often this functionality can fit nearly into a single "Advanced" group).
|-
| [size="0.8"]{$INC,cs_count,1})[/size]
[color="red"]Use the standard method for showing groups of alternative fields[/color]
| Consistent UI, usability
| Composr development +
| Manually
| Use the [tt]alternate_fields_set__start[/tt] system to mark alternative fields (i.e. the case where users may enter something in a field, or something in a different field, but never in both fields). Look at examples in existing code to see how it works.
|-

| Use object-orientated principles properly where Composr does already. For example, forum drivers all have a database object as a property, rather than referencing the global [tt]FORUM_DB[/tt] object. This is because they provide a core service and cannot make assumptions about the environment (e.g. it must be possible to have multiple simultaneous forum drivers running).

| Stability
| All development
| Manually
| If you are supporting Composr attachments in a field, run the [tt]check_comcode[/tt] function on the Comcode that references the attachments before the main row for the content is added to the database. This ensures the Comcode is valid, so you can proceed to add the content row (using the integer [tt]0[/tt] temporarily as the field value for where the Comcode will be placed). The attachment Comcode can then be fully parsed (given the ID of the content row, so it can store its security properly) and then the content row updated with the new language string ID for that parsed Comcode.

All this inconsistency is ingrained in English, but for any single term, reference it in a uniform way. We do not usually use the antiquated form of abbreviations using dots (e.g. "M.W.").

Most lang strings support HTML, some do not: be aware
| Stability

| You may assume language strings can contain HTML. There are only a few exceptions where this is not true. Theoretically the burden usually lies on code removing HTML formatting that is there and can't be used, rather than the other-way-around. Practically, there are some cases where HTML entities are allowed but not HTML tags (e.g. if a language string is used for a [tt]title[/tt] attribute), and you will just need to use your judgement and test if you change an existing language string to include HTML tags. The flip-side to HTML being allowed is that you must encode things like the ampersand symbol as entities.

If you must use a CSS reset then it will need adjusting to be scoped beneath a particular position(s) in the DOM tree.

Similarly, don't apply overly-broad styles thinking you'll undo them for any case that does not match -- any broadly defined style must be a very general one, because you won't want to add dozens of exceptions back in to cater for the pre-coded HTML usage that Composr has in its myriad of templates.

The best thing to do is usually to re-use an existing colour definition -- not only does that make the colour palette consistent, it stops you needing to calculate a new equation. We made our calculations using Photoshop, by adding white/black layers above the [tt]seed[/tt] color and adjusting its opacity.
[tt]/*{$,hardcoded_ok}*/[/tt] may be put next to a colour for very rare exceptions.

| Themeing: the Theme Wizard needs to keep working
| Product development only

| The default border colour is black, which doesn't look great on our default theme, but may look far worse on other themes. Always set a colour for borders and follow the above rule so that the Theme Wizard can set the colour. To find a border colour, just grab the code from an existing bit of CSS that performs a similar styling to what you want.

Use relative font sizes
| Accessibility
| Product development only
| Automated test ([tt]web_resources.php[/tt])
| We want output to be easily scalable, so write sizes using [tt]em[/tt]. It's really easy: if you want something smaller, use something like [tt]0.85em[/tt] and something bigger like [tt]1.1em[/tt]. The advantage to scaling is a themer can easily knock the whole theme's font sizing up, and also it is possible to proportional down-scale content for embed contexts. There is a tool to convert the default theme to [tt]px[/tt] units for designers who prefer it (professional designers have good reason to want to do pixel-perfect designs).

This allows PHP code to automatically add vendor prefixing and make dynamic modifications should there be some kind of standards change in the future. Don't mark stuff beta if it works unprefixed on all supported browsers.

[title="4"]JavaScript[/title]

We broadly follow the same kind of conventions other JavaScript developers do, but with a focus on modern ways of doing things wherever possible.
JavaScript has been historically a very clunky language with a messy history of new innovations that get constantly recycled as the basic platform moves forward or developers fight over approaches. We've designed a framework that moves beyond all this as much as possible. Our framework is broadly post-jQuery (although we do have jQuery bundled for third-party code) and post-preprocessor (because JavaScript is more powerful on its own than it was in the past) and polyfill-charged.

You do not need to:
1) define jsdoc fully
2) minify scripts (Composr does it for you)
3) make third-party libraries meet our particular choice of standards (we trust third-party developers to have their own methods for ensuring standards are high) [exclude JavaScript libraries from automated testing by putting [tt]/*{$,parser hint: pure}*/[/tt] at the top of the file]

[color="red"]Code formatting[/color]
| Consistency
| Product development only
| Manually
| Generally code is formatted the same way as PSR-2 is specified and with spaces around operators, except with JavaScript we use camelCase for identifiers rather than underscores, and we place function opening braces on the same line as the function declaration. For functions assigned to a variable we put a space between the function keyword and opening bracket ([tt]function (foo)[/tt]). Rather than us prescribing all the rules we suggest looking at existing code to see how to do it.
|-

[color="red"]Use polyfills[/color]
| Future proofing
| Composr development +
| Manually
| We want to align to future versions of JavaScript. If we want to benefit from future functionality then we typically will add a polyfill for that (loaded up in [tt]global.js[/tt]) rather than adding a compatibility layer in the framework or implementing an alternative. This allows us to easily remove the polyfill later when we can, and also let's us get better performance.

Fix any strict warnings
| Standards compliance, future proofing
| Product development only
| JavaScript files should have [tt]use strict;[/tt] in, automated test ([tt]js_strict_mode.php[/tt])
| In the past Firefox's strict mode (prior to the standardised strict mode) would complain about ever referencing undefined variables/properties, but that's not an issue now. Ideally don't check things are defined just using a raw [tt]if[/tt] because it's not very clear. However, it is acceptable to do an [tt]if[/tt] that considers [tt]undefined[/tt]/[tt]null[/tt]/[tt]false[/tt] [i]values[/i] to be the same thing (a missing function parameter will be an [tt]undefined[/tt] [i]value[/i] on an actual variable). For referencing variables that don't just hold an [tt]undefined[/tt] value but really are undefined, do check them like [tt]object.foo == undefined[/tt] or [tt]object.foo === undefined[/tt] (if null shouldn't count). It is important to include the object (which may be [tt]window[/tt]), otherwise the strict mode will complain.

[color="red"]Name DOM nodes variables as [tt]el[/tt] as appropriate[/color]
| Consistency
| Product development only

| It is very common for JavaScript code to be manipulating a single DOM node. If we consistently call this [tt]el[/tt] then the code is easier to scan over.
|-

[color="red"]Use standard system for reading function parameters[/color]
| Consistency

| Any language strings that are not in either [tt]global.ini[/tt] or [tt]critical_error.ini[/tt] must be referenced using the full [tt]{!file:CODENAME}[/tt] syntax. This is because we cannot assume what language files have already been explicitly loaded before any individual JavaScript file is evaluated.

Do not reference global variables directly
| Stability
| Composr development +
| Automated test ([tt]web_resources.php[/tt])
| Reference global variables and functions that are defined outside any particular [tt].js[/tt] file by explicitly prefixing them with [tt]window.[/tt]. This allows the JavaScript code scanner to detect undeclared variables because there's no longer an ambiguity.

Do not omit semicolons

[color="red"]Use [tt]href="#!"[/tt] for JS-controlled links[/color]
| Stability
| Product development only
| Manually
| This is a special value used by Composr to indicate "prevent default" that you can make use of. There's a global listener for all clicks which finds such links and calls [tt]e.preventDefault()[/tt] so to not make the screen jump. [tt]href="#!"[/tt] is used because [tt]href="#"[/tt] could have valid uses like "jump to top".

| Stability
| Product development only
| Automated test ([tt]js_standards.php[/tt])
| Calls to [tt]{$IMG}[/tt] must be wrapped with [tt]$util.srl()[/tt]. This is because they need to be turned from absolute URLs to relative URLs, just in case a JavaScript file is cached under HTTP but used under HTTPS (it would generate a security error).

| Use of [tt]{$PAGE_LINK}[/tt] will encode [tt]keep_[/tt] parameters, including potential session IDs. It must therefore be passed into JavaScript via an HTML [tt]data-[/tt] attribute, or you must generate with the [tt]{$PAGE_LINK}[/tt] parameter to avoid [tt]keep_[/tt] parameters and manually attach them using [tt]$cms.keep()[/tt] (being very careful on whether the existing URL does or doesn't have a [tt]?[/tt] in already, which may vary by URL scheme).

Explicitly set sizes using HTML [tt]width[/tt]/[tt]height[/tt] attributes or the CSS [tt]background-size[/tt] property.
