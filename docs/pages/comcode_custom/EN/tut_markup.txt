This tutorial focuses mainly on XHTML, CSS and JavaScript, which are the three technologies one needs to understand to do advanced themeing. Links to full resources for learning these technologies are also provided.

[title="2"]URLs[/title]

Like all websites, a Composr site uses [abbr="Uniform Resource Locator"]URL[/abbr]s (aka web addresses) to link pages. Within Composr, they are usually written as Composr page-links (defined above in "Overview") and then compiled to URLs at the same time the XHTML is generated.

URLs (when written in full) are constructed as follows:
[code="URL"]
protocol://server:port/path?parameter=value&anotherparameter=anothervalue&anotherparameter=anothervalue
[/code]

They are constructed as follows:
 - [b]Protocol[/b]: For a web page, the protocol is always 'http' or 'https' (because the page is transferred via the HTTP(S) protocol).
 - [b]Port[/b]: The port is almost always '80' which is the default port. If the port is 80 then it is not written down (i.e. ":80" is actually not in the URL).
 - [b]Hostname[/b]: The server is either specified by a domain name or an IP address.
 - [b]Path[/b]: The path often relates to a file on the server, but does not have to: it is up to the web server how to treat it. For a Composr site the path usually points to a PHP file on the server (which the web server will recognise as being something it has to run, and relay the output), except if a URL Scheme is on then it might go through a level of indirection (e.g. it looks to the visitor like it refers to an [tt].htm[/tt] file but actually is invisibly redirected to go through a complex path involving the [tt]index.php[/tt]).
 - [b]Parameter(s)[/b]: There can be any number of parameters (including none). The first one has a "?" before it and subsequent ones have a "&" before it.

Here is a real example:
[code="URL"]
http://example.com/somepath/deeper/something?one=1&two=2
[/code]

This deconstructs as follows:
 - [b]Protocol[/b]: This is an [tt]HTTP[/tt] URL.
 - [b]Port[/b]: As the port is not specified this is on the standard port 80.
 - [b]Hostname[/b]: This is on the machine where the domain name [tt]example.com[/tt] points to.
 - [b]Path[/b]: The path is [tt]somepath/deeper/something[/tt].
 - [b]Parameter(s)[/b]: We have two parameters [tt]one[/tt] as 1, [tt]two[/tt] as 2.

[title="2"]XHTML[/title]

XHTML5 (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is the language in which the Composr layout is written, and is what Composr is designed to output. A markup language is a text-based formatting system that allows an author to designate the structure and importance of pieces of a web page. You can't have a web page without markup; all web pages consist of markup. XHTML5 is the same as HTML5 except written to a higher standard of tidiness. It is designed with XML (eXtensible Markup Language) compatibility in mind.

As previously mentioned, all Composr pages are output as XHTML. To customise the appearance of your site, it is just about impossible to do anything major without editing the XHTML. In Composr, the XHTML is split up into various templates for ease-of-use and reusability. Composr also has an inbuilt XHTML webstandards checker, to help you in customising your site.

[title="3"]Syntax[/title]

The basic concepts behind XHTML are very simple: your document starts with a document-type definition, then the markup follows. The markup consists of various [concept]tag[/concept]s, each with optional and mandatory [concept]attribute[/concept]s.
[code="HTML"]
<tagname attribute1="attribute1value" attribute2="attribute2value">tagcontent</tagname>
[/code]
As you can see, the markup is quite simple. The tag consists of an opening part, and a closing part, with content in-between, and attributes listed in the opening part. However, some tags can be even simpler, and not contain any content, or even a closing part.
[code="HTML"]
<tagname attribute1="attribute1value" attribute2="attribute2value" />
[/code]
This form of tag is called self-closing, but is only found occasionally. For both forms of tag, however, there are some rules and guidelines that should be followed:
 - Don't place extraneous spaces in the tag (i.e. between the less-than and the first character of the tag name)
 - [b]Always[/b] close the tag with a closing part, or a self-closing part
 - Don't put more than one space between anything

Tags can contain as many attributes as you like, but they must be valid, and you can't repeat the same attribute twice. Let's look a little closer at the syntax for an attribute.
[code="Text"]
attributename="attributevalue"
[/code]
The syntax for an attribute is quite simple, too. However, there are some rules and guidelines you must stick to:
 - Encase the attribute value in double-quotes
 - Don't surround the equals with spaces (it must be next to the last character of the attribute name, and the opening double-quote for the attribute value)
 - Keep the attribute name lower case

Putting tags together is only slightly more complex than using single tags. You must bear in mind that XHTML is designed to produce a tree-structure of tags: one tag will contain several others ([i]descendants[/i]), which in turn will contain another few (more descendants), or some text, etc.
[code="HTML"]
<tag1>
	<tag2>
		<tag3>Text</tag3>
		<tag4 />
	</tag2>
	<tag2>Text</tag2>
</tag1>
[/code]

A key part of this is the fact that there is some required markup in all XHTML documents: the three root tags. These tags ([tt]<html>[/tt], [tt]<head>[/tt] and [tt]<body>[/tt]) [b]must[/b] be present in a particular place in [b]every[/b] XHTML document along with a valid document-type definition and some required attributes, or browsers won't be able to make head-or-tail of the page.
[code="HTML"]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
		<title>Sample page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
[/code]
That is just about the smallest valid page possible. However, you needn't worry about all this, as Composr already has the basic XHTML structure in-place and working perfectly.

One of the nice things about XHTML is the fact that you can place extraneous whitespace (spaces and tabs) between tags, to make the markup easier to read.
[code="HTML"]
<tag1>
	<tag2 />
</tag1>
[/code]
Doing this when writing markup is [b]highly advisable[/b] as it saves hours of searching through markup to find closing parts, etc.

Up until now, we've only been working with theoretical and fictional XHTML tags and attributes. Next it's time to introduce you to some of the most commonly-used tags. However, first it must be noted that XHTML is not a [b]layout[/b] language! It should not be used with the intention of creating a page with a particular appearance! XHTML coding should be approached with a purely structure-based mindset. That is, XHTML should be used to [b]mark-up the structure of the document[/b] (e.g. headings, paragraphs, sections, links, lists, and other such [b]structural[/b] paradigms). Anybody who uses XHTML with the intention of creating a page that looks a particular way is using it [b]incorrectly[/b]. To learn about how to style a page, see the CSS section below.

Although the above table doesn't list all of the XHTML elements (it lists approximately half of them), the others are used so rarely it's easier to look them up when required, than learn them first. This table also does not list all the attributes of all the elements. However, it lists the important ones, and the following table lists all the attributes that can be used with any XHTML element; the standard attributes.

There are other standard attributes, but only four, and they're used exceedingly infrequently. Note that there are also event attributes (see JavaScript section below).

[title="3"]Element types[/title]

Now that you've learnt all the XHTML elements, how to use them, and their attributes, you might think it's all over. This is not true; XHTML has a final surprise for you.

As you might have guessed, you can't put any element inside another. There are rules. The basic rule is that of block-level and inline elements. Every XHTML element is either a block-level element, or an inline element (with a few exceptions, which are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but they don't behave particularly differently anyway.) Block-level elements may contain either other block-level elements or inline elements. However, inline elements may only contain other inline elements.

Examples of block elements: [tt]div[/tt], [tt]p[/tt], [tt]body[/tt], [tt]ul[/tt], [tt]li[/tt]

Examples of inline elements: [tt]span[/tt], [tt]h1[/tt], [tt]a[/tt], [tt]strong[/tt], [tt]em[/tt]

Examples of other elements (not so easily classifiable): [tt]html[/tt], [tt]head[/tt], [tt]style[/tt], [tt]script[/tt], [tt]table[/tt], [tt]tr[/tt], [tt]td[/tt]

[title="3"]Example[/title]

What follows is an example XHTML document, utilising all of the above principles:
[code="HTML"]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Example HTML document</title>

[title="2"]CSS[/title]

CSS (Cascading StyleSheets) is the language used to style and position elements in a webpage. The advantage of separating [i]content[/i] and [i]structure[/i] from [i]style[/i] and [i]layout[/i] is that if, for example, you have a separate CSS file (i.e. the CSS is not embedded into the XHTML), you can easily apply a standard style across a whole website, without duplicating the CSS over and over again (which would inevitably lead to omissions, errors, and maintenance problems).

CSS is a simple language, consisting of [i]rules[/i], which contain various [i]properties[/i]; the individual parameters for styling an element.
The basic format of a rule is as follows.
[code="CSS"]
selector {
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]
The [i]selector[/i] defines which XHTML elements/classes/IDs the properties in the rule are applied to, the [i]property[/i] is the predefined name of the property, and the [i]property-value[/i] is the value assigned to the property (the allowed values vary from property to property). Note the spaces, colons and the semi-colon at the end of the property line.

There are several types of selector defined by the CSS 1 standard, which we will cover here. There are also several new selectors defined by both CSS 2 and CSS 3, but they are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The most basic selector is the [i]type selector[/i], and it selects all the XHTML tags in the markup of the specified name.
[code="CSS"]
p {
	property: property-value;
}

div {
	property: property-value;
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]
The CSS above would apply the specified properties to any [tt]<p>[/tt] or [tt]<div>[/tt] element in the page.

Another basic selector is the [i]class selector[/i], which selects all XHTML tags with the specified class attribute value.
[code="CSS"]
.warning {
	property: property-value;
}
span.timestamp {
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]
This example applies the specified properties to any tag which has a class of [tt]warning[/tt], or any [tt]<span>[/tt] tag which has a class of [tt]timestamp[/tt]. Note that you can combine type and class selectors together (as in the second rule in the above example), to produce a class selector which only applies properties to tags with the specified class, that also are of the specified tag name.

A little aside explanation about the XHTML class attribute is probably required here. As mentioned in the XHTML section above, it is a standard attribute, and as such can be applied to any element. It should contain a space-separated list of CSS class selector names to be applied to the tag. Usually, however, only one class selector is listed in the class attribute.
[code="HTML"]
<div>
	<span class="timestamp red">Warning received yesterday.</span>
	<p class="warning">I know you know that I've been messing with knowledge. However, I'd like you to forget that I know what you know, and that you don't know what I know. I know more about what you know that you could possibly ever know about my knowledge. My knowledge about your knowledge of what I know regarding now is secret, and I know that you know about the now and then of knowledge, new life, and gibberish.</p>
</div>
[/code]
In that example, the [tt]<span>[/tt] tag has two CSS classes attached. However, it should be noted that when naming CSS classes, you should name them for their [i]function[/i], rather than for their [i]appearance[/i]. This is for maintenance considerations: if you name a class [tt]red[/tt], then change the colour to blue, you'd have to rename it, and change all the references to it, or leave it as a mess.

ID [i]selectors[/i] are another basic selector type, which apply properties to elements based upon their ID attribute (for more information on the ID attribute, see the JavaScript section below).
[code="CSS"]
#main-doc {
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]
Note that this rule should (in theory) only be applied to [b]one[/b] tag in the entire page (if at all), as the ID attribute of any tag should be [b]unique[/b]. Due to this, the ID selector isn't used as frequently as other selectors, and when it is used, it is usually used for basic page layout rules, such as positioning the title, main body, and menus. Note also that ID selectors can be coupled with type selectors, as with the class selector.
[code="CSS"]
h1#title {
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]

The final basic selector is the [i]descendant selector[/i], which applies properties to specific tags, but only if they are a descendant of another specified tag (or tags). Note that it applies the properties to the final tag in the sequence (i.e. the right-most tag in the selector).
[code="CSS"]
h3 a {
	property: property-value;
}
[/code]
This example applies the specified properties to any [tt]<a>[/tt] tag which is beneath a level-three heading ([tt]<h3>[/tt]).

Now that the basic selectors have been covered, we move on to properties and property values. A property can only accept [b]one[/b] out of a list of predefined values. Some values are variable (such as widths, and other numeric values), but most are just text.

Some commonly used properties are listed below...

Note that most of these properties can be split up into separate properties (i.e. [tt]margin[/tt] can be split up into [tt]margin-left[/tt], [tt]margin-right[/tt], [tt]margin-top[/tt] and [tt]margin-bottom[/tt]).

All these properties are no use without property values. Although most elements only accept values from a property-specific predefined list, some elements accept more general values, such as pixel or percentage measurements.

Pixel measurements should generally be used for fixed-size objects, which are usually encountered when doing the basic layout of a page.
[code="CSS"]
#left-col {
	width: 200px;
}
[/code]
Percentage measurements are much better to use, however, as they allow dynamic resizing of page layout if the browser window is resized.
[code="CSS"]
#left-col {
	width: 20%;
}
[/code]

There are other general property values, but they are beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The final part of the CSS jigsaw is [i]inheritance[/i], or [i]cascade[/i]. This is one of the main features of CSS, and gives it power and flexibility. The basic principle is that properties applied to one tag are automatically applied to any descendant tags of that tag (with a few exceptions for sanity's sake). So, for example, if you had a rule that applied a red text colour to an element, that element's descendants would also have red text, unless they had rules applied to them to override this.

[i]Cascade[/i] is actually a variation of inheritance, on a larger scale. Specifically, it is the inheritance of rules in the hierarchy of stylesheets. Although only applicable for very large sites, it is important to know about: a stylesheet can import another stylesheet using something called the '@import' rule. [i]Cascade[/i] is when the rules and properties from the first stylesheet cascade into the second stylesheet, and are applied to elements unless overruled.

[title="2"]JavaScript (advanced)[/title]

JavaScript is the final piece in the web development puzzle. It allows dynamic, event-driven, interactive functionality, and is the prime component of emerging technologies such as Ajax.

It would be pointless to go into a detailed explanation of JavaScript and how to script in it, as all the JavaScript a developer could ever require is available online already.
However, it is useful to be able to understand roughly what some JavaScript does, and the concepts behind it.

JavaScript is a [i]client-side[/i] scripting language; the web server sends the raw JavaScript to the client's browser, which goes through it, performing the specified operations. It is very fast, and can manipulate a webpage in microscopic detail.

JavaScript generally consists of [concept]function[/concept]s, which contain lines of code.
[code="JavaScript"]
function function-name(argument1,argument2)
{
	lines-of-code;
}
[/code]
Functions have to start with the [i]keyword[/i] [tt]function[/tt], then the name of the function, and the arguments required to be passed to the function in parentheses. Following this should be the lines of code in the function, surrounded by curly brackets.

The lines of code themselves have to follow strict rules (which are beyond the scope of this document), and have to be terminated with a semicolon.
[code="JavaScript"]
function is_IE()
{
	if (navigator.appName == "Microsoft Internet Explorer")
	{
		return true;
	}

	return false;
}
[/code]

JavaScript is most powerful when applied to the DOM -- the Document Object Model, which is a way of accessing the properties and attributes of every node in the document tree of an XHTML (or XML, etc.) page. You don't need to know about how to use the DOM in JavaScript, you just need to know that the DOM extensively references the IDs of XHTML elements, specified by their ID tag.

Another feature of JavaScript is its event model. You can specify JavaScript functions or code to be called when, for example, a link is clicked. You do this either via the event attributes in an XHTML document, or through event listening functions in JavaScript.

[html]
<table class="columned-table results-table wide-table autosized-table">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>
				Event attribute
			</th>
			<th>
				Description
			</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
		<tr class="zebra-0">
			<td>
				<p><kbd>onload</kbd></p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Called when the document loads. Can only be put
				in <kbd>&lt;body&gt;</kbd>
				or <kbd>&lt;frameset&gt;</kbd>
				tags.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="zebra-1">
			<td>
				<p><kbd>onchange</kbd></p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Called when an input is changed. Can only be
				put in one of the form tags (<kbd>&lt;input&gt;</kbd>,
				<kbd>&lt;select&gt;</kbd>,
				etc.).</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="zebra-0">
			<td>
				<p><kbd>onsubmit</kbd></p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Called when the form is submitted. Can only be
				put in a <kbd>&lt;form&gt;</kbd>
				tag.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="zebra-1">
			<td>
				<p><kbd>onkeypress</kbd></p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Called when a key is pressed (and released) and
				the element has focus. Can be put in any tag, with a few logical
				exceptions.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="zebra-0">
			<td>
				<p><kbd>onclick</kbd></p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Called when a the element is clicked. Can be
				put in any tag, with a few logical exceptions.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
[/html]

To use these event attributes, simply put them into the tag.
[code="HTML"]
<a href="http://example.com/" title="Example website" onclick="log_click('http://example.com/'); ">example.com</a>
[/code]

You can also put more than just a function call into event attributes.
[code="HTML"]
<a href="http://example.com/" title="Example website" onclick="window.alert('You clicked the link!'); log_click('http://example.com/'); ">example.com</a>
[/code]

JavaScript is a flexible language, and many things can be achieved by using it. However, you must remember that styling should be left to CSS, structure should be left to the XHTML, and JavaScript should be used for interactivity.

It should also be stressed as a last point that [b]JavaScript is not secure[/b]; if you write a login system in JavaScript that checks an inputted password against a one coded into the JavaScript, anybody can just view the source of the JavaScript using their browser, look through it, and extract the password with ease. This goes for other similar situations as well, such as quizzes; the answers, passwords, or any other potent information that should be kept secret. It should be stored, processed, and handled exclusively [b]on a server[/b]!
