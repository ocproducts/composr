[title sub="Written by Chris Graham (ocProducts)"]Composr Supplementary: How to disable joining[/title]

This tutorial explains how you can disable joining of your website. It also is a good example of how to use match-key error messages.
The tutorial assumes that the [tt]match_key_permissions[/tt] addon is installed.

Composr can be customized to disable joining, but this is not a directly configurable option. Instead, webmasters can deny access to the [tt]join[/tt] page in their site.

Follow these steps to set the permissions:
[list="1"]
[*] Go to Admin Zone > Security > Permissions Tree Editor.
[*] Select "Join". You can see a green circle next to "Module: join" since the list reflects Guests' permissions.
[*] Then you can change the permission for each usergroup for this [tt]:join[/tt] page in the box given. Use the "+/-" button to select/deselect all the check boxes. Deselect all the check boxes.
[*] Press the "Set" button to save the changes.
[*] You will see a success message on the screen which you can dismiss.
[*] You will see it has changed the colour of the circle displayed next to the "Join" to red, since Guest users cannot access the ":join" page now.

Follow these steps to set a custom error message:
[list="1"]
[*] We can customise the access-denied error message displayed in the join page by going to:
Admin Zone > Security > Match-key page restrictions.
[*] Enter the page name ([tt]:join[/tt] in our case) in the "Match-key" box and a custom message in the "Message" box under the "Match-key permission-denied messages" heading.
[*] Press the "Save" button to apply changes.
[*] We can check this feature by going to:
[tt]http://yourbaseurl/index.php?page=join&keep_su=Guest[/tt]
(we are using [tt]keep_su[/tt] to masquerade as Guest, to avoid having to log out).
[/list]
[/surround]

Now, the page will display your error message and a login screen.
