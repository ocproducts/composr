{!cns:DOC_EMOTICONS}

If you are using a third-party forum, that forum will be responsible for management of emoticons, and Composr will use those from the forum.

If you are using the Composr forum, Conversr, emoticon management features are provided, as well as a very large set of emoticons.

Conversr emoticons are tied into the theme image system, although you are unlikely to need to know this as the images may be manipulated using direct features (Admin Zoen > Style > Emoticons).

Images are associated with the 'code' that is typed to place the emoticon. You may have multiple codes per image, by using a single image in multiple emoticons: the interface allows you to select from existing images when you add. It is possible to bulk import emoticons from zip files.

Emoticons are given a relevancy level, which determines which areas they are listed for use in. The relevancy levels are described in the interface.
You can also determine whether an emoticon can be used as a 'topic emoticon' (an emoticon placed next to a topic on the forum). It is best to only use standard sized emoticons as topic emoticons.
