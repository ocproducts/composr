[title sub="Written by Chris Graham, ocProducts"]Composr Tutorial: Running a collaboration hub: the Collaboration Zone[/title]

Composr includes many features that allow your website to function, in whole or in part, as an on-line collaboration tool. Many of these features are, by default, pooled together and placed in the 'Collaboration Zone', a Composr zone available, by default, only to staff and Super-Members (if the latter group exists).

A Super-Member is a member who is not staff, but is granted additional access based on their need to access collaborative resources. There is no hard-coded concept of a Super-Member in Composr but the default configuration for the Collaboration Zone is to grant access only to staff and the 'Super Members' usergroup.

The Internet, combined with Composr, is a powerful tool for online-collaboration. It provides the ability for people across the world to work together; but even when used by people working in the same building it can still be a great aid in the sharing and organising of information.

Composr can be used to organise shared documents, provide a forum for discussion, make announcements, structure information, chat from across the world, and a lot more.

[title="2"]Default settings[/title]

By default, some resources (Comcode pages, menu links, and catalogues), are created in the Collaboration Zone:
 - A 'Projects' catalogue (so that super-members can advertise projects they are working on, to solicit help with them)
 - A page about how the Super-Member can request web-hosting-space
 - A link for the Super-Member to manage their author profile
These may be used, deleted, or moved, according to your specific needs.

[title="2"]File/Media library[/title]
[surround]
The File/Media library is a tool to allow sharing of files, located in the CMS zone. It provides the ability to upload, download, and delete files, and organise files into folders.
[box="Important note" width="25em" float="right"]There is nothing stopping ordinary users from downloading from the file/media library if they have the URL to a file. This is sometimes useful, but you should be aware that if files are given guessable filenames, they will not be secure.[/box]

[/surround]

The File/Media library has two main purposes:
1) Sharing media with the staff team, for use in content
2) A general shared drive for collaborators

You can get a browser to embed items from the File/Media library. Go to add a new Comcode tag (from the button in the WYSIWYG editor / above the text-area) and select the <kbd>media</kbd> tag.

[title="2"]Other Super-members[/title]
[surround]
[media width="150" description="The Super-members fellows page" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/collaboration_supermembers.png[/media]
The Collaboration Zone includes a page listing all members that have access, with links to information relating to them, and to contact them. It exists to make sure super-members are aware of each other, and to facilitate easy communication between them.
[/surround]
[title="2"]Additional resources that may be used[/title]

The following are not by default set up for specifically for Super-Members, but may be:
 - Blogs (Personal news categories)
 - Personal galleries
 - Private forums
 - Private chat rooms
 - Sole access to any Composr feature, such as the download system, or Wiki+.

If a Composr website is intended solely for collaboration, and the collaborators are trusted, it might be a good idea to make each of them staff, rather than a super-member.
