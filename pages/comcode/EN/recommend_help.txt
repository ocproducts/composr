[title sub="Recommending {$SITE_NAME}"]Help[/title]

When you recommend our site or a piece of content on our site, you can either:
[list="a"]
[*] type in the details of your contacts manually
[*] upload a [abbr="comma-separated Values"]CSV[/abbr] file of contact details
[/list]

[title="2"]CSV files[/title]

If you choose to upload a CSV file we will give you a choice to choose which contacts you would like to recommend to before sending -- don't worry we won't spam anyone on your contact list!
